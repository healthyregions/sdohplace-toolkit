Human-Centered Design (User-Focused Design Approach)          | An approach to problem-solving that starts with people and ends with innovative solutions tailored to suit their needs. It involves understanding the perspective of the users for whom you're designing, generating a range of ideas, and iteratively testing and refining solutions
Participatory Design (Collaborative Design Approach)          | A process that involves all stakeholders, especially users, in the design process. The aim is to ensure that the designed product meets the needs and expectations of the users. It often involves workshops, user interviews, and collaborative sessions where users actively contribute ideas and feedback.
Design Thinking (Problem-Solving Framework)          | A non-linear, iterative process used to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. It comprises five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. This approach encourages questioning, experimentation, observation, and innovation.
Universal Design (Accessibility-Focused Design Approach)          | Involves creating products and environments that are accessible and usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. It emphasizes simplicity, intuitiveness, and accommodating a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
Experience Design ([XD] User Experience Focused Design Approach)          | Focused on the quality of the user experience and culturally relevant solutions. It goes beyond the product itself to include all aspects of the user's interaction with a company, its services, and its products. "
