<p>By the end of this module, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze spatial data visualizations in public health</li>
<li>Identify your stakeholders’ needs</li>
<li>Select the best spatial visualization type for your project</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of spatial data visualizations as your bridge to meaningful conversations in public health. Nevertheless, crafting insightful maps, dashboards, or other spatial representations can be challenging, due to both technical and methodological hurdles. The path to creating an effective spatial data visualization does not commence with software usage; rather, it initiates with stakeholder meetings, annotations, and sketches. Therefore, the primary objective of this module is to encourage you to invest time in thinking about your potential visualization and considering the individuals who will reap its benefits.</p>
<p>Annotations, sketches, and meeting summaries can be handwritten in a notebook or digitally generated on a computer. We recommend creating a journal for this toolkit to annotate and store your notes. Your toolkit journal will assist you in organizing your thoughts, creating new content, making sketches, saving code, writing notes from meetings, and reflecting on your mapping process. Indeed, the production of relevant visualizations related to SDOH is a lengthy and complex process that requires creativity, organization, and technological skills. Your journal can be an invaluable companion on your journey.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Refining Goals<a href="01-intro.html#refining-goals" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Think of the start of your project as setting out on a road trip. First, you need to map out where you want to go. What do you hope to discover along the way? Your visualization techniques are like choosing the right vehicle for the journey—each has its strengths for different terrains. Your goals will evolve as you travel, finding new paths to explore. But it all starts with a clear destination in mind.</p>
<div id="roadmap" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Roadmap<a href="01-intro.html#roadmap" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Let’s consider these common goals as your potential roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying Health Disparities</strong>: You can employ spatial visualizations to identify areas with disproportionate health burdens and disparities. For example, by mapping health outcomes and demographic data from the census, it could become evident which communities or populations experience higher rates of diseases or poor health, shedding light on potential health inequities.</li>
<li>Targeting Interventions: Another option is performing spatial analyses to target interventions and resources to areas with the greatest need. By creating asset maps, you could aid public health advocates to direct their efforts, and allocate resources to address health disparities and promote equity.</li>
<li>Assessing Access to Healthcare: You can produce maps to evaluate the accessibility of healthcare services across different regions. These cartographies identify areas with limited access to medical facilities or services, which is crucial in understanding barriers to healthcare for marginalized populations and addressing health disparities.</li>
<li>Modeling the social determinants of health at Different Scales: You can produce geostatistical analyses to model how social determinants of health (SODH) affect communities at different scales. By studying and mapping these factors, you may better understand how social conditions influence health outcomes and equity.</li>
<li>Environmental Health: You could create a dashboard to assess environmental health risks and exposures. By combining graphs, maps, and tables you may identify areas with environmental hazards that disproportionately affect specific communities, contributing to health disparities.</li>
<li>Health Planning and Policy Interventions: Your maps can inform stakeholders in their efforts to create effective policies. By deploying various spatial visualizations, you can support interventions targeting specific health challenges in various communities, ultimately promoting health equity.</li>
<li>Community Engagement: Story maps or collaborative mapping projects may facilitate community engagement by providing social experience insights. These representations allow community members to participate in decision-making, voice their concerns, and collaborate with public health officials to design interventions that address their unique needs and concerns.</li>
<li>Monitoring and Evaluation: Spatio-temporal dashboards are effective tools to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. By comparing health outcomes before and after implementing interventions, public health officials can assess whether disparities are decreasing and health equity is improving.</li>

<p>Once you’ve got your project’s goals on the horizon, it’s time to look at who’s journeying with you. Collaboration and stakeholder identification are vital components of any project that aims to achieve equity. Whether it’s a non-governmental organization, a research group within a university, or a government agency, stakeholders bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the table. Similarly, communities, activists, and advocates can also play a significant role in your project’s success.</p>
<p>Early identification of stakeholders is key to building trust and solidarity, which is a time-consuming but necessary process. By working together with your stakeholders, you can produce an impactful SDOH project.</p>
<div id="motivations" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Motivations<a href="01-intro.html#motivations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Here’s how this alliance can shape your journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding Diverse Perspectives: Stakeholders come from various backgrounds and sectors, each bringing unique insights that can challenge and enrich your project’s approach to health. A government official might understand policy implications, while a local activist might provide a grassroots perspective on community health challenges.</li>
<li>Data Gathering and Validation: Collaborators are crucial in both collecting and validating SDOH data. They ensure that the information reflects real-world conditions and is relevant to the communities affected. Researchers can provide rigorous methodologies, while community members can offer qualitative insights that ground the data in lived experiences.</li>
<li>Expanding the Network: Engaging with stakeholders allows for the expansion of your network. Each stakeholder may introduce you to other relevant parties, broadening the reach and potential impact of your project. This can lead to discovering untapped resources or finding new avenues for support and advocacy.
Exploring New Contexts: Stakeholders can act as guides through unfamiliar territories, both metaphorically in the project domain and literally in the community spaces. They help navigate the cultural, social, and political landscapes that shape health outcomes.</li>
<li>Innovative Co-Design: Utilizing User-Centered Design principles, stakeholders become co-creators in developing spatial visualizations that represent SDOH. Their input ensures that the end products are not only technically sound but also culturally sensitive and user-friendly.</li>
<li>Forging Partnerships: Collaboration can lead to long-term partnerships that extend beyond the life of a single project. These relationships can build a foundation for future initiatives, creating a sustainable impact on public health.
Revising Project Goals: Stakeholders often provide new insights that can lead to a reframing of project goals. What begins as a narrow focus on a particular health issue might evolve into a more holistic approach that considers a wider range of social factors.</li>
<li>Ensuring Equity: By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, the project is more likely to address equity in a meaningful way. Equity is not just about equal access, it’s also about designing interventions that acknowledge and address power imbalances and historical contexts that contribute to health disparities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Module 2, we will delve deeper into employing User-Centered Design to engage stakeholders effectively. The aim will be to ensure that every step of the project, from conception to implementation, is done in collaboration with those who have a vested interest in the outcomes, guaranteeing that the resulting initiatives are equitable, impactful, and sustainable.</p>

<p><em>–&gt; Marynia will edit this section a bit, more about how this is about community and contextual SDOH, not individual level. Should also note that spatial data is a different data format than regular data (different than what was referenced below in current version)</em></p>
<p>After understanding the significance of refining objectives and finding stakeholders, it is crucial to take into account one of the essential elements in your project–the spatial component. This toolkit underscores the fact that social determinants of health encompass more than personal genetics or healthy habits. According to the World Health Organization, social determinants of health refer to the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (<a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople" class="uri">https://health.gov/healthypeople</a>, accessed 11 October, 2023 ). By adopting a spatial view of SDOH, we can research how communities are affected by the places they inhabit. For instance, we can evaluate their access to health care, transportation, recreation, and green areas. On the other hand, some communities may be exposed in their neighborhoods to crime, racism, and pollution. By mobilizing spatial visualizations, we can identify and address these inequalities.</p>
<p>The spatial data we need for our visualizations can be quite different. While censuses and databases can provide a starting point, it’s important to understand their nature - what they include and what they leave out, who generates them (whether it’s the public or private sector), and what their intended purpose is. Scrutinizing spatial data is critical to start conceiving your spatial visualization.
Think of spatial data as your high-powered lens zooming in on a community’s heartbeat. It lets you see beyond the surface to the underlying structures—like healthcare reach, parks, and transport. And yes, it also uncovers the shadows of crime, discrimination, and pollution. In your SDOH project, you can typically use three types of spatial data: primary, secondary, and tertiary. In the following section, we will provide a brief description of each of these types of data.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/intro-data.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Types of data, (graphic created by Kamaria Barronville)</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>Primary Spatial Data: Primary spatial data refers to the data that you can collect either personally or through a sensor/machine which you or your stakeholders have previously installed. There are several examples of spatial visualizations of SDOH made with primary data. Some researchers have used online interviews or questionnaires to analyze their experiences in their neighborhood. Other researchers have placed sensors to map air quality in cities. The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or smartphones is another way to generate primary data.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary Spatial Data: You may encounter challenges when gathering SDOH primary spatial data, as it can be a time-consuming and costly endeavor. As a result, SDOH researchers, mapmakers, and advocates frequently turn to various secondary resources, such as spatial databases and census records, to inform their spatial representations. Typically, these files consist of digital layers that are prepared for seamless incorporation into a GIS or web mapping application. However, you can also work and manipulate non-spatial data in your project. Notable sources for such data include both profit and non-profit databases, government census information, and even digitized or scanned paper maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Spatial Data: In the realm of SDOH spatial visualizations, there exists a third option–your map(s) may access other maps’ spatial data. Tertiary spatial data are spatial layers that have been previously or currently utilized in other cartographies and are readily accessible for integration into a Geographic Information System (GIS) or web mapping applications. When engaging with stakeholders experienced in health mapping, it’s worth inquiring whether they possess any spatial layers that could prove beneficial for your project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is key to emphasize that data can often be tainted by biases and errors. As a result, the methods used to gather, aggregate, or model spatial data can have adverse effects on the quality of our data visualizations. It is of utmost importance to meticulously scrutinize various forms of data, whether they are qualitative (e..g, interviews or questionnaires), quantitative (e.g., databases), or mixed (e.g., surveys). A valuable starting point for data analysis involves assessing metadata within databases or interview questions. Further insights into this subject will be explored in subsequent sections of this toolkit.</p>

<p>Throughout this module, we’ve concentrated on exploring your objectives, recognizing prospective stakeholders, and delving into the spatial data at your disposal for your research. As we progress, we will now examine how these three features converge when it comes to choosing an appropriate spatial visualization. To facilitate this, we will introduce four distinct types of visualizations for investigating social determinants of health: Asset maps, dashboards, thematic maps, and story maps.</p>
<p>Alright, you’ve got your goals and your team – now, let’s talk about bringing it all to life with the right kind of map. It’s like choosing the perfect outfit for the right occasion; each type of spatial visualization has its moment to shine when exploring the social determinants of health. Let’s browse through the wardrobe: Asset maps, dashboards, thematic maps, and story maps – each has its own flair.</p>

<p>[Asset mapping] (<a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300351" class="uri">https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300351</a> involves engaging with community members, stakeholders, and local organizations to gather information and collaboratively build the map. The process can be facilitated through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and public meetings. The resulting asset map is a visual tool that provides a comprehensive view of the community’s strengths, potential partnerships, and areas where support and resources are available. The assets included in an asset map can be diverse and encompass various categories, such as:
- Physical Assets: These include tangible resources like parks, schools, hospitals, community centers, libraries, public transportation, and other infrastructure elements.
- Human Assets: Human resources within the community, such as skilled individuals, volunteers, community leaders, and organizations’ staff, are valuable assets.
- Social Assets: Social assets refer to the networks, relationships, and social capital present in the community, including support systems, cultural groups, and community organizations.

<h4>Activity 1.4:<a href="01-intro.html#activity-1.4" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>After exploring the four spatial visualizations (e.g., story maps, thematic maps, dashboards, and asset maps), it is essential to reflect on their advantages and limitations. Create a list of three advantages and three limitations for each of the four visualizations that we reviewed in this module.</p>
<p>For example, you could focus on which visualization is better suited for displaying a place’s historical health trends, analyzing the impact of a pandemic, or explaining the results of a public policy? Which visualization requires some experience with statistics and coding, and which one requires experience with the humanities and storytelling?</p>
<p>Project Tip:</p>
<p>Module 1 is just the beginning of a process. To keep progressing, it’s essential to always look for inspiration and stakeholders. Take some time to explore various web maps, dashboards, atlases, magazines, and academic articles. Then, list the ones you find appealing in your journal. Even if they are spatial visualizations that have nothing to do with health, try to imagine how you can use their design to study SDOH.</p>

<div id="module-1-activity" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Module 1 Activity:<a href="01-intro.html#module-1-activity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Think of a problem you want to solve. Write down your purpose and objectives by clearly stating why you want to solve this problem and what you hope to achieve. Who is your target audience?</p>
<p>Next, make a list of your potential stakeholders. How would you contact your stakeholders and why would they be interested in collaborating with you? Would you be part of an ongoing project or propose a new one?</p>
<p>The format for this exercise is flexible and exploratory. You can opt to create lists of objectives, draw diagrams, write a structured plan, or engage in a free-writing exercise.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this task is to develop a foundation to begin exploring spatial data for your project.It’s important to note that your final prototype might diverge significantly from what you record in this entry, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Remember, the process of using SDOH spatial data for visualizations is a dynamic process.</p>

<div id="summary-of-module-1" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Summary of Module 1<a href="01-intro.html#summary-of-module-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In Module 1, the focus is on goal setting for a spatial visualization project related to social determinants of health (SDOH) in public health. Here’s a summary of the key points:</p>
<p>Objectives (1.1):
- Clarifying project goals is the initial step.
- The choice of visualization techniques is closely tied to project objectives.
- General goals include identifying health disparities, targeting interventions, assessing access to healthcare, modeling SDOH at different scales, evaluating environmental health, informing health planning and policy, engaging the community, and monitoring and evaluating interventions.</p>
<p>Stakeholders (1.2):</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration and stakeholder identification are essential for achieving equity.</li>
<li>Stakeholders can be organizations, researchers, government agencies, communities, activists, and advocates.</li>
<li>Early identification of stakeholders builds trust and solidarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spatial Data (1.3):
- Social determinants of health encompass conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.
- Spatial data is crucial for understanding how communities are affected by their environments.
- Three types of spatial data are primary (collected personally), secondary (from databases and census records), and tertiary (previously used in other maps).</p>
<p>Data Visualizations (1.4):
- Four types of spatial visualizations are discussed: asset maps, data dashboards, story maps, and thematic maps.
- Asset maps focus on community strengths and resources.
- Data dashboards present health-related data in a user-friendly format.
- Story maps combine maps, text, images, and multimedia for storytelling.
- Thematic maps use visual symbols to represent specific health-related data or themes within a geographic area.</p>
<p>The module also encourages exploring external resources and encourages participants to think about their own project’s purpose, objectives, target audience, and potential stakeholders. It emphasizes that Module 1 is the beginning of a dynamic process in the journey of using spatial data for SDOH visualizations in public health.</p>
