<p>In this module, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to spatial data concepts and operations</li>
<li>Convert CSV lat/long to spatial points and geocode address</li>
<li>Overlay points with boundary data, merge SDOH data, visualize as choropleth</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You’ve spent some time visioning your project goals, breaking down specific needs, and connecting with potential users of the application. Once you’ve done these things, you’re ready to take on the data at hand, and start wrangling. Because we’re working with place-based SDOH data, that means learning how to handle <em>spatial data.</em> Working with spatial data is like working with regular data, plus entirely new dimensions. The data formats are different, and you’ll need different tools to work with it.</p>

<p>Which computing environment should you work with spatial data? It’s up to you — there are many options to choose from today. Our toolkit focuses on free and opensource tools, and/or tools that are widely available with low cost. In this chapter, we’ll work with <em>QGIS</em>, <em>Excel</em>, and <em>GeoDa.</em></p>
<div class="tools">
<p>For this module, you need the following installed on your machine. A recent, stable version is sufficient; note that versions will be updated regularly, so you’ll need to learn to update, manage, and troubleshoot as you go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QGIS</strong>: explain, link</li>
<li><strong>Excel</strong>: explain, link</li>
<li><strong>GeoDa</strong>: explain, link</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you prefer to code, or want to practice coding, go to the Appendix to learn the same materials using the R Programming Language.</p>
<p>Throughout, you’ll learn the tool you’re using isn’t as important as your ideas, concepts, and goals. You can merge data, run a buffer analysis, and make a map using ESRI, QGIS, R, Python, Spatial SQL or any other number of software or coding languages. Your goal is to learn what you want to do, understand why you need to do it, and learn &amp; discover as you go.</p>
<p>That being said, data wrangling takes up <strong>at least 80%</strong> of a traditional GIS/spatial analysis project. Don’t underestimate the time needed to resolve challenges, and practice patience.</p>

<p>Spatial data is essential for understanding the world around us, as it combines information with specific locations. This type of data is vital because it allows us to see how information changes with location. Without the geographical component, we’re left with just a list, not a spatial analysis or map that can guide decisions or provide insights.</p>
<p>Understanding these aspects of spatial data is crucial, especially as we delve into more complex analyses. Whether it’s navigating through the components of a shapefile or exploring data in R, having a grasp on these concepts can help tackle the challenges that come with spatial data analysis.</p>
<div id="spatial-data-types" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Spatial Data Types<a href="04-data.html#spatial-data-types" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>*from our opioid toolkit below – change up language a bit **</p>
<p>Two common formats of spatial data are vector and raster data. Vector data represents the world surface using points, lines, and polygons whereas raster data can be satellite imagery or other pixelated surface. The figure below demonstrates how vector and raster data models represent geographic space differently, where points, lines, and polygons consist of the essential basis of the vector data model.</p>
<p>** add cool drawing of points/lines/polygons</p>
<p>We mainly use vector data for our purpose. For example, a group of clinics can be geocoded and converted to points, whereas zip code boundaries are represented as polygons. Note that spatial data types include the basic attributes in addition to their spatial information. So points on a map correspond to associated details for each clinic provider, and may also include fields like “name”, “services”, and more.</p>
<p>For example, a park can represented as a polygon or a point. Linked with each park, we can have information regarding their names, sizes, types of plants, open hours, and other various features. These attributes can be stored in a data table, along with their spatial inforamtion, in a shapefile, or a spatial file loaded in your R environment.</p>

<h3>More Types of Data<a href="04-data.html#more-types-of-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>While we focus on tabular spatial data in this introductory module, you may work with multiple types of data in your SDOH project that is linked to place. Another of thinking about this is considering spatial data as primary, secondary, or tertiary. In the following section, we will provide a brief description of each of these types of data.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Primary Spatial Data</strong>
</summary>
Primary spatial data refers to the data that you can collect either personally or through a sensor/machine which you or your stakeholders have previously installed. There are several examples of spatial visualizations of SDOH made with primary data. Some researchers have used online interviews or questionnaires to analyze their experiences in their neighborhood. Other researchers have placed sensors to map air quality in cities. The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or smartphones is another way to generate primary data.</br></br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Secondary Spatial Data</strong>
</summary>
You may encounter challenges when gathering SDOH primary spatial data, as it can be a time-consuming and costly endeavor. As a result, SDOH researchers, mapmakers, and advocates frequently turn to various secondary resources, such as spatial databases and census records, to inform their spatial representations. Typically, these files consist of digital layers that are prepared for seamless incorporation into a GIS or web mapping application. However, you can also work and manipulate non-spatial data in your project. Notable sources for such data include both profit and non-profit databases, government census information, and even digitized or scanned paper maps.</br></br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tertiary Spatial Data</strong>
</summary>
In the realm of SDOH spatial visualizations, there exists a third option–your map(s) may access other maps’ spatial data. Tertiary spatial data are spatial layers that have been previously or currently utilized in other cartographies and are readily accessible for integration into a Geographic Information System (GIS) or web mapping applications. When engaging with stakeholders experienced in health mapping, it’s worth inquiring whether they possess any spatial layers that could prove beneficial for your project. </br></br>
</details>
<p>It is key to emphasize that data can often be tainted by biases and errors. As a result, the methods used to gather, aggregate, or model spatial data can have adverse effects on the quality of our data visualizations. It is of utmost importance to meticulously scrutinize various forms of data, whether they are qualitative (e..g, interviews or questionnaires), quantitative (e.g., databases), or mixed (e.g., surveys). A valuable starting point for data analysis involves assessing metadata within databases or interview questions. Further insights into this subject will be explored in subsequent sections of this toolkit.</p>
<p>In your project, there’s no need to limit yourself to just one kind of data. In fact, it’s not only possible but often necessary to mix and match different sources and types of spatial data to craft compelling SDOH spatial visualizations.</p>
<div class="activity">
<p>Review these projects below and identify what type of data they use. In your opinion, what other types of data could they use to enrich their visualizations?</p>

<h3>Spatial Data Formats<a href="04-data.html#spatial-data-formats" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>*from our opioid toolkit below – change up language a bit **</p>
<p>Spatial data can be stored in a text file like comma-separated value (CSV) files. However, the text file needs to have essential location columns with latitude and longitude to represent the coordinate location of a spatial object. Furthermore, a CSV file with lat/long columns is only a flat/non-spatial file, until the spatial location context is enabled as a new spatial data format.</p>
<p>A common spatial data format is the shapefile, which comes from ESRI/ArcGIS proprietary software. The shapefile file format (<code>.shp</code> for short) includes a minimum of 4 files, with a common prefix and different filename extensions <code>.shp</code>, <code>.shx</code>, <code>.dbf</code>, and <code>.prj</code>. In order to work with the spatial data, we need all these four components of the shapefile stored in the same directory, so that the software or coding platform being used can know how to project spatial objects onto a geographic or coordinate space. Other common spatial data formats include the GeoJSON (or <code>.geojson</code>)or geopackage (or <code>.gpkg</code>). We’ll work with shapefiles and GeoJSONs in this toolkit.</p>

<h3>Coordinate Reference Systems<a href="04-data.html#coordinate-reference-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The Earth is an irregular ellipsoid, rather than a perfect sphere. As a result, many ways of visualizing the Earth, in whole or in part, have been developed. A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) communicates what method should be used to flatten or project the Earth’s surface onto a 2-dimensional map. Different CRS imply different ways of projections and can generate substantially different visualizations. For example, the following are some world maps using different projections:</p>
<p><em>pic from slide 13 intro2spatialmed</em></p>
<p>In addition to projections that optimize for global accuracy, there are many regional projections. For instance, NAD83 (North American Datum 1983) is divided into several UTM (universal transverse mercator) zones across the continent. So when projecting a dataset of Illinois, for example, the most appropriate NAD83 projection would be NAD83 UTM zone 16N. Projection names have also been standardized to EPSG codes. The projection NAD83 UTM zone 16N is EPSG:26916.</p>
<p>Many datasets available online, and GeoJSON files as a general rule, default to the projection <code>EPSG:4326</code>, a global projection used by GPS. Changing projections can be critical for improving accuracy for your project, and making sure your layers are being displayed using the same information. Always search the internet to determine what projection is most appropriate for your project, and to find the corresponding EPSG code.</p>
<p>** explain why EPSG 4326 sucks, distance in degrees, why we have to change often **</p>

<p><strong>Change Projections in QGIS</strong></p>
<p>Inspect the current projection.
- In the bottom right corner of QGIS, the projection for the project as a whole will be listed as the EPSG code. Select this to change the projection. Since we’re working with a Chicago dataset, let’s change the projection to EPSG:26916.</p>
<p><em>screencap available: 1projection</em></p>
<p>Notice how the shape of the city boundary changed, now that the projections are not in agreement. Inspect the projection for the boundary layer by right clicking on the layer and going to Layer CRS. The current projection should be EPSG:4326. Since the project is now in EPSG:26916, you should see the option Set to EPSG:26916. This may cause the layer to move enough that it is no longer visible on your screen. If this ever happens, use Zoom to Layer(s) to return to your layer. Now you can see the boundary shape has changed again with the projections being back in agreement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Converting to Spatial Data<a href="04-data.html#converting-to-spatial-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A common goal in SDOH research is to work address-level data, known as <em>points</em> or <em>events</em> (when considering time) in spatial analysis research. This could refer to resources in a community, . Before we can run any analytics on the resource location data, we need to convert resource addresses to spatial data points, which can be then used to calculate access metrics.</p>
<p>Locations, when measured as points, can include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health providers</strong>: Hospitals, Clinics, Pharmacies, Mental health providers, Medication for opioid use disorder providers</li>
<li><strong>Area resources</strong>: Grocery stores &amp; Supermarkets, Playgrounds, Daycare centers, Schools, Community centers</li>
<li><strong>Area challenges</strong>: Crime, Superfund sites, Pollution-emitting facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Points can also represent people, like individual patients residing in an area. Because individual locations for persons is protected health information, we’ll focus on point data as resources in the chapter. However, you can reuse the approach in this workshop to wrangle patient-level data the same way in a secure environment, under the guidance of your friendly IRB ethics board.</p>
<p>Let’s start with an example where the spatial coordinate information has already been embedded within the dataset as latitude and longitude information.</p>

<p>** redo below using QGIS since we’re already using it??</p>
<p>Comma separated (CSV) files are not spatial data; they may <em>contain</em> spatial data, but to be used for spatial analysis or mapping they will need to be converted to a spatial data format, such as a <code>GeoJSON</code> or <code>shapefile</code> data format. As long as a CSV contains spatial data, GIS software should allow you to save CSV data as a new spatial data file.</p>
<p>There are multiple options for converting CSV files to spatial data without code using opensource software like QGIS or GeoDa.For this type of conversion, you’ll want a CSV file with coordinate information (e.g. longitude and latitude) in separate fields.</p>
<p>** long/lat = x/y, not the other way</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Geocode Addresses<a href="04-data.html#geocode-addresses" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>If you start with only addresses, you’ll need to geocode!</p>
<p>Addresses are not spatial data. They are real-world representations of spatial data, but GIS software will not be able to map them without further information. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates using a known coordinate reference system (CRS). We can then use these coordinates (ex. longitude, latitude) to spatially enable data.</p>
<p>** Explain that there are multiple geocoding services available, with varying quality. How precise does your measure need to be? Do you want to reject matches with &lt;90% uncertainty? If you’re at a university or public sector setting, you may have access to ESRI geocoding services… Also note how you should NEVER geocode sensitive data as it’s not HIPPA protected unless on a compliant server…</p>
<p>** After determining the service, plan for data cleaning/preparation stage, matching goals</p>
<p>** redo following section as tool-neutral tips : QGIS may be having an issue reading some specific addresses due to formatting issues in the CSV. Suite or apartment numbers, for example, may cause QGIS to be unable to geocode addresses. Only include the street address in the address column of your CSV. If you want to retain apartment or suite numbers, include them in a separate column in your CSV. An address may also be miswritten in your CSV file, even something as small as an extra apostrophe will prevent an address from being geocoded properly. Edit your CSV to be properly formatted, and upload it again. <em>Note: you may need to close and reopen QGIS if you add columns to your CSV as part of this editing process.</em> Many cities have addresses that are duplicates or are very similar. Providing QGIS the most information you can is the best way to resolve this issue. QGIS can use street address, city, state, and country information to geocode addresses. If you do not already have all of this information in your original CSV, add it and try geocoding again.</p>
<div class="activity">
<p><strong>Geocode with QGIS</strong></p>
<p>For this exercise, download <code>chicago_methadone_nogeometry.csv</code>, explain what this is….</p>
<p>To geocode addresses in QGIS, first you will need to install the plugin MMQGIS. Go to Plugins -&gt; Manage and Install Plugins. Search MMQGIS, and install it.</p>
<p><em>screencap available: 4mmqgis</em></p>
<p>Once installed, the plugin should be visible on the toolbar across the top. Select MMQGIS -&gt; Geocode -&gt; Geocode CSV with Web Service.</p>
<p><em>screencap available: 5geocodepathway</em></p>
<p>Upload your CSV file. Confirm the correct fields are being read, choose your web service (OpenStreetMap is the open source option), and name your output files and select the file formats. Hit apply, and the addresses should appear as points, and a spatial data file should have been generated and appear on the left side of your screen as a new layer.</p>
<p><em>screencap available: 6geocodeparameters</em></p>
<p>Once all your addresses are appearing, investigate them to ensure that everything has geocoded properly. For small datasets, this can be done by investigating the layer attribute table. Right click your geocoded layer and select Open Attribute Table. In addition to the information from your CSV, QGIS will have added a few more pieces of information, including the full address and lat/long. Take a look at this information to ensure everything has in fact appeared at the correct address. If you have a dataset confined to a single city, this can be done very quickly by checking the lat/long data for any outliers. However, this method is not suitable for larger datasets. For datasets of all sizes, adding a basemap will contextualize your data and allow for a quick visual inspection.</p>
<p>Add a basemap to quickly visually inspect your data points. From the layers sidebar, right click your geocoded spatial data file and select Zoom to Layer(s). If any data points lie outside your expected spatial extent, this will quickly alert you to that issue. The point data may have defaulted to a style that is difficult to see against this base map. Right click your geocoded spatial data file and select Styles to edit the size, color, and shape of your data points.</p>
<p>Once everything has geocoded properly, you’ll have a spatial data file ready to use in other software.</p>

<p>Merging datasets is a vital skill for analyzing health data from an SDOH perspective. SDOH data and health data will often be in separate datasets, but use the same geographic scale, such as zip code or census tract. Being able to merge these kinds of datasets together using that scale is important to the ease of performing analysis with your data.</p>
<div id="reshape-data" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Reshape Data<a href="04-data.html#reshape-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Datasets often don’t come in GIS-friendly formats. Data may be separated vertically among multiple variables rather than horizontally along a single identifying variable. To merge data to boundaries, we’ll have to reshape from long to wide format.</p>
<p>– explain long vs wide data formats</p>
<p>– long preferred in epi work</p>
<p>– wide formats needed to spatial data</p>
<div class="activity">
<p><strong>Wide to Long with Excel</strong></p>
<p>File: COVID-19_Cases__Tests__and_Deaths_by_ZIP_Code.csv</p>
<p>To create a wide dataset with the cumulative cases for each week for each zip code, create a pivot table in Excel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the CSV as an excel file, and open a new sheet.</li>
<li>Go to Insert -&gt; Pivot Table. Select the data you wish to include; in this case, we want the cumulative case data. Choose the icon on the right of the Table/Range selection box, and select columns A-F from the original excel sheet. Make sure the pivot table will be placed in the new excel sheet, and hit OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pivot table will open with the selected data, which can be sorted into rows, columns, values, and filters. In this example, the zip codes should be our rows, so choose Zip Code from the selection and drag it into Rows. We want our columns to be organized by week, so drag any of the Week Number, Week Start, or Week End into the Columns. You’ll notice these variables split into multiple categories when dragged into a pivot table field. Use the information icon at the side of each category to hide the Months and Days, leaving you with just the original variable. Finally, drag Cases - Cumulative into the Values to fill out the table.</p>
<p>Use the drop down menu for Row Labels or Column Labels to remove any unwanted rows or columns. You’ll notice a Grand Total for each column and row has also been created, which can be removed. Also remove the first row that includes Sum of Cases and Column Labels, and rename the column containing zip codes, from Row Labels to Zip Code. These extra columns and rows could make it difficult for other software to read your CSV later. Your completed pivot table (and its fields creator*) will look something like this:</p>
<p><em>screencap available: 8pivotresult</em></p>

<p>** Merge SDOH data to Zip Codes in GeoDa</p>
<p>Here, we’ll merge datasets with a common variable using GeoDa. Merging the cumulative case dataset you created in the last section to zip code spatial data will allow you to map the case data. First, open the Chicago zip code GeoJSON file in GeoDa. Open the table and identify the column name that contains zip code information. You’ll be merging the case data and spatial data using zip codes.</p>
<p>First, however, you’ll notice that the zip codes are repeated. This is a quirk of the dataset, and this data needs to be cleaned before we can continue with merging the data. Select one row for each zip code and save the selection as a new geojson, ChiZipCleaned. You’ll notice that two zip codes (60643 and 60707) have repeats that are not exactly alike. This is because these two zip codes have small exclaves, and so are listed separately since they are separate polygons. However, having the repeated zip code will create problems when merging the data, and the exclaves are small enough not to be relevant for our analysis. Only choose the rows with a larger area for these two zip codes. Your selection should come to 58 zip codes.</p>
<p>Open ChiZipCleaned.geojson. Go to Table -&gt; Merge. Select the cumulative case dataset. Under parameters, select Merge by key values, with zip selected for current table key and Zip Code selected for import table key. Move over all data columns you want to see in this merged dataset.</p>
<p>*Note: you do not need to include Zip Code since this field is being used to merge the two datasets, including it will only duplicate zip codes in the resulting dataset.</p>
