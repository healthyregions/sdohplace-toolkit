[["index.html", "The SDOH &amp; Place Community Toolkit Preface", " The SDOH &amp; Place Community Toolkit The Healthy Regions &amp; Policies Lab 2024-01-24 Preface The SDOH &amp; Place Project Community Toolkit aims to increase the capacity for community and civic organizations in health to: Access and work with social determinants of health (SDOH) data (i.e., place/spatial data) Use place data for social good and to further health equity Develop engaging and compelling apps to inspire, activate, and retain users Work within an open ecosystem infrastructure In order to identify and engage with the necessities of different social actors, the community toolkit is based on the principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD). HCD is a well-researched framework that ensures the potential users’ desires, abilities, and contexts are at the core of interactive systems and applications. HCD consists of four main steps: identifying users’ needs, designing for those needs, evaluating, and iterating. Inspired by HCD, the community toolkit is built upon an ongoing co-creation and evaluation process that leverages the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, and analysts. The SDOH &amp; Place Project Community Toolkit connects equity principles with analysis and design of spatial visualizations for SDOH spatial data. This toolkit draws inspiration from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission’s findings, which assessed how communities’s health and life expectancy are affected by the places where they live. To address this issue, RWJF has previously created resources to promote health equity. Currently, the community toolkit contains six modules. Depending on your project’s objectives, you can opt to undertake either one module or several of them: Module 1 guides users in identifying and formulating their visualization goals, recognizing potential stakeholders, and prioritizing health equity in their planning. Module 2 emphasizes the importance of user-centered design principles in spatial visualization and evaluates various engagement strategies with stakeholders. Module 3 focuses on the integration of spatial data into projects, covering data-wrangling methods, technologies, and the role of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in spatial visualization. Module 4 delves into the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis in the context of social determinants of health (SDOH). Module 5 introduces users to multiple low or no-code applications for creating mapping visualizations. These open-source applications concentrate on four cartographic approaches for mapping SDOH: story maps, asset maps, thematic maps, and data dashboards. Module 6 addresses how users can evaluate and disseminate their SDOH mapping projects, underscoring the importance of ongoing stakeholder engagement.

The social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass a range of historical, social, cultural, and economic factors that significantly impact the well-being of individuals and their communities. These social determinants of health (SDOH) aren’t just statistics; they’re stories of communities and the places we call home, varying from one street to the next. They’re about whether we have parks over parking lots, fresh food on shelves, and whether our neighborhoods are marked by support or segregation. Social Determinants of Health (graphic created by Kamaria Barronville) Academics, activists, government agents, and policymakers have employed data visualizations to examine the connections between places and SDOH. For example, they have utilized dashboards to study the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities. They implemented participatory mapping to advocate for policy-based interventions, and deployed story maps to promote health initiatives. To produce these data visualizations, health researchers and advocates mobilize a wide array of conceptual frameworks and diverse technical skill sets. Moreover, data visualizations in public health do not only analyze the relationship between places and SDOH. They promote health equity: “a state in which everyone has a fair and equitable opportunity to achieve their highest level of health” (CDC’s Office of Health Equity, 2022). 1.2 Dynamic Data Visualizations Visualizing public health data isn’t just about the “what”—it’s about the “so what?” It’s about crafting digital narratives that anyone can access, understand, and use to make a difference. These visual tools are our digital megaphones and meeting places—they bring us together, keep us informed, and push us towards action. Data visualizations in public health that advance equity are digital tools designed to provide accessible and comprehensive data related to public health indicators, focusing on reducing health disparities and promoting equity among different populations. These tools often combine various data sources and visualization techniques to present information in a user-friendly and easily understandable format. The data dashboard, for example, was a commonly used tool during the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate community spread Data visualizations can be used by community members and organizations, research groups, policymakers, and more to empower individuals to better access and mobilize SDOH data and advance health equity. Within the realm of public health, maps, dashboards, and interactive web applications can be created to foster fairness through an inclusive design that accommodates diverse user groups and their varying degrees of health equity. These tools are not only visually appealing and easy to comprehend, they also provide valuable insights. They adapt to the needs of different social actors by combining well-suited graphics, animations, and audio-visual elements. They even offer networking tools (e.g., messaging boards) for seamless data exchange and user interaction. These interactive features also serve to promptly update users about any alterations. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation from Greece produced a storymap to present their current health initiatives The Stavros Niarchos Foundation from Greece produced a storymap to present their current health initiatives (source: https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/ddf1b1212ec9c9aac4bebe45196b367d/hi-update-english/index.html) 1.2.1 Is there app for that? In the ever-evolving landscape of data visualization and technology, it’s essential to explore existing tools and applications before embarking on a new project. This not only saves time and resources but also allows you to benefit from the wealth of solutions that may already address your needs. Here are some ideas to help you determine if there’s an app or web visualization that aligns with your SDOH data visualization project: Research Existing Solutions Start by conducting thorough research on existing data visualization tools and applications. Look for platforms that specialize in healthcare, public health, or social determinants of health. Consider both general-purpose visualization tools and those specifically designed for SDOH. Explore App Marketplaces Check popular app marketplaces such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and web-based platforms for healthcare applications. Look for user reviews, ratings, and feedback to gauge the effectiveness and user satisfaction of existing tools. Collaborate and Network Connect with professionals in the field of public health and data visualization. Attend conferences, webinars, or join online forums where experts discuss SDOH projects. Networking can provide valuable insights into tools that have been successfully used in similar projects. Evaluate Open Source Solutions Consider open-source visualization tools and frameworks. Open-source projects often have active communities and can be tailored to specific needs. GitHub and other repositories are great places to explore such solutions. Consult with Peers and Stakeholders Reach out to colleagues, peers, and stakeholders involved in similar projects. They might have insights into tools that have proven effective in their work. Collaboration can lead to shared resources and knowledge. Check for Integration Capabilities If your project involves integration with existing systems or databases, ensure that the identified tools have the necessary integration capabilities. Compatibility with data sources is crucial for a seamless visualization experience. Consider Customization and Scalability Assess whether the existing tools can be customized to meet the specific requirements of your SDOH data visualization project. Additionally, evaluate their scalability to accommodate potential future expansions or changes in data sources. Evaluate Cost and Licensing Analyze the cost implications and licensing requirements of using existing tools. Some applications may be free, while others might have subscription fees or licensing agreements. Factor in your budget constraints when making a decision. By thoroughly exploring existing solutions, you can make informed decisions about whether to build from scratch or leverage the capabilities of existing apps and web visualizations for your SDOH project. Remember, a well-researched approach can lead to more efficient and impactful data visualization outcomes. 1.3 Centering Equity The concept of equity in public health data visualizations goes beyond mere stylistic enhancements to aid in comprehension or research. It extends to encompass connections to pertinent resources and diverse language options, for example, empowering communities with information, processes, and agency to transform, advocate for, and influence residents, neighborhoods, and broader political, economic, and social structures towards healthier systems. Let’s dive deeper into how we can make data visualizations not just informative, but also inclusive and impactful. You see, it’s not all about graphs and numbers. By weaving in stories and multimedia—like videos and interactive media streams—we open up a world where data talks to everyone, not just to those who love statistics. Imagine a dashboard that not only shows you the trends but also tells you the stories behind the numbers. It’s designed with real people in mind, adapting to a variety of preferences—whether you’re someone who loves a good narrative or someone who digs deep into the data. However, we’ve got to acknowledge that sometimes, our public health systems fall short. They miss the mark on painting the full picture of health disparities. That’s why, when we’re talking about Place &amp; SDOH, we need to put equity at the heart of our work—from the word go, right through to the final pixel of the design. It’s not just a ‘nice-to-have’; it’s a must-do for visualizations that truly resonate with and serve all communities. 1.3.1 Equity Orientation The equity orientation in a public health data system involves several key components that must be outlined to address health disparities and promote equitable outcomes effectively. These components include: 1.3.1.1 Setting Parameters of Equity: Decision-Making Inclusion: The process of setting parameters for equity should involve diverse stakeholders, including representatives from marginalized communities, to ensure that the perspectives and needs of all affected populations are considered. Target Population: It is crucial to identify the specific populations and communities that are the focus of efforts to improve equity. This includes recognizing vulnerable groups that historically experience disparities in health outcomes. 1.3.1.2 Focus on Equity: Differential Needs: An equity-oriented approach acknowledges that different populations have varying needs and histories. It recognizes the importance of tailoring interventions to address these disparities rather than assuming that a one-size-fits-all approach will be sufficient. Addressing Historical Considerations: An equity-oriented system acknowledges historical injustices and systemic discrimination that have contributed to current health disparities. It seeks to redress these past injustices and provide opportunities for affected communities to improve their health and well-being. 1.3.1.3 Subject of Equity: Inclusivity: The subject of equity encompasses all individuals and communities facing health disparities, including marginalized and underserved groups. Generational and Historical Considerations: An equity-oriented data system takes into account intergenerational and historical factors that have contributed to health disparities. It recognizes that current health outcomes are influenced by past policies and practices. 1.3.1.4 Content of Equity: Procedural Equity: This aspect of equity focuses on ensuring that the decision-making processes and procedures are perceived as fair and transparent. It involves involving affected communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions. Distributive Equity: Distributive equity concerns how social welfare and resources are distributed to meet the needs of different populations. It aims to allocate resources in a way that reduces health disparities and provides equitable access to healthcare and other essential services. Contextual Equity: This aspect acknowledges that pre-existing social conditions (such as poverty, discrimination, and access to resources) influence equity. An equity-oriented data system considers these contextual factors when designing interventions to address health disparities effectively. Centering Equity (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9508440/, graphic created by Kamaria Barronville). 1.4 Types of Applications Throughout this module, we’ve concentrated on exploring your objectives, recognizing prospective stakeholders, and delving into the spatial data at your disposal for your research. As we progress, we will now examine how these three features converge when it comes to choosing an appropriate spatial visualization. To facilitate this, we will introduce four distinct types of visualizations for investigating social determinants of health: Asset maps, dashboards, thematic maps, and story maps. Alright, you’ve got your goals and your team – now, let’s talk about bringing it all to life with the right kind of map. It’s like choosing the perfect outfit for the right occasion; each type of spatial visualization has its moment to shine when exploring the social determinants of health. Let’s browse through the wardrobe: Asset maps, dashboards, thematic maps, and story maps – each has its own flair. 1.5 Testing Knitbook blah blah 1.5.1 Asset Maps These are like your community’s highlight reel, showcasing everything from the vibrant parks and schools to the people who make your area tick. They’re about celebrating what’s there, not just what’s missing, and sparking conversations about building on those strengths. Community Food Map, (Source: University of Illinois https://eat-move-save.extension.illinois.edu/#food-finder) Asset mapping involves engaging with community members, stakeholders, and local organizations to gather information and collaboratively build the map. The process can be facilitated through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and public meetings. The resulting asset map is a visual tool that provides a comprehensive view of the community’s strengths, potential partnerships, and areas where support and resources are available. The assets included in an asset map can be diverse and encompass various categories, such as: - Physical Assets: These include tangible resources like parks, schools, hospitals, community centers, libraries, public transportation, and other infrastructure elements. - Human Assets: Human resources within the community, such as skilled individuals, volunteers, community leaders, and organizations’ staff, are valuable assets. - Social Assets: Social assets refer to the networks, relationships, and social capital present in the community, including support systems, cultural groups, and community organizations. - Economic Assets: These include businesses, local enterprises, job opportunities, and other economic resources that contribute to the community’s well-being. - Cultural Assets: The cultural assets encompass the traditions, heritage, arts, and cultural events that enrich the community’s identity and cohesion. - Environmental Assets: Natural resources, green spaces, environmental initiatives, and sustainable practices are considered environmental assets. Asset Maps empower communities, steer strategic planning, and guide resource allocation. They’re about networking and flipping the script to a more positive community narrative. Data Dashboards: Imagine your health community’s stats brought to life in real-time – a dashboard that’s part control panel, part story, helping everyone from officials to neighbors make sense of the numbers. In public health, [data dashboards] (https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/assets/4472-19438/lessons-learned-dashboard-norc-brief.pdf) are digital tools that provide visual representations of key health-related data and indicators. Here’s an example of a dashboard that highlights users stories, [New Video Series: Moving from Data to Action | City Health Dashboard] (https://www.cityhealthdashboard.com/blog-media/1501). These dashboards are specifically designed to present public health data in a user-friendly and easily understandable format, enabling stakeholders, policymakers, researchers, and the general public to access and interpret critical information about population health. United States of Health, (Source: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/us-public-health-dashboard) Data dashboards in public health typically include the following features: - Health Indicators: Dashboards display a variety of health indicators, such as disease rates, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, hospitalization rates, environmental health data, and other relevant metrics. - Geospatial Data: Many public health dashboards utilize spatial data to present geostatistical analysis in real-time, allowing users to understand health patterns and disparities across different geographic regions. - Time Series Data: Dashboards often provide data over time, allowing users to observe trends, track changes, and identify seasonal patterns in health outcomes. - Demographic Disaggregation: Public health data dashboards may disaggregate data by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This helps identify disparities and understand how health outcomes vary among different population groups. - Comparisons and Benchmarks: Dashboards may include the ability to compare health outcomes across regions, states, or countries, as well as against national or global benchmarks. - Data Sources and References: Transparent dashboards typically provide information about the sources of data, data collection methods, and references to ensure data credibility. - Interactivity: Interactive elements allow users to customize the dashboard, apply filters, and explore data based on their specific interests and questions. - Alerts and Notifications: Some dashboards include alerting features to notify users about significant changes in health indicators or emerging health threats. - Data Dashboards keep a pulse on public health, from tracking diseases to zooming in on health equity. They’re transparent, interactive, and always on the lookout with alerts. Story Maps: A [story map] (https://ica-abs.copernicus.org/articles/3/245/2021/ica-abs-3-245-2021.pdf) in public health is a powerful and interactive tool that combines maps, text, images, and multimedia elements to tell a compelling narrative about health-related issues, initiatives, or research. These are your digital storybooks, weaving maps with tales and images that take you on a journey through health challenges and triumphs. It allows public health professionals to present complex data, trends, and information in a visually engaging and accessible manner, making it easier for a wide range of audiences to understand and connect with the subject matter. The Mapping of Race in America (Source: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac998a8425b54e319f61d34ff1a94a0c) Key features and uses of story maps in public health include: - Data Visualization: Story maps use maps and data visualizations to illustrate health-related trends, patterns, and disparities across geographic regions. This can include disease prevalence, access to healthcare, environmental health risks, and other relevant data. - Narrative Communication: Story maps are structured to present information in a storytelling format. Public health professionals can use narrative elements to explain the context, significance, and implications of the data, helping the audience grasp the larger story behind the statistics. - Health Education and Promotion: Story maps are an effective educational tool to raise awareness about public health issues, promote healthy behaviors, and disseminate health-related information to the public. - Community Engagement: Story maps can engage communities in public health initiatives by presenting data and insights in a way that is relevant and relatable to specific geographic areas or demographics. - Policy Advocacy: Public health professionals can use story maps to advocate for specific policy changes by visualizing the impact of current policies and proposing evidence-based solutions. - Environmental Health: Story maps can be used to communicate information about environmental health hazards, pollution, and their impact on public health. They can also showcase initiatives aimed at improving environmental conditions and public health outcomes. - Outbreak Response and Preparedness: Story maps can be utilized during disease outbreaks to track the spread of infections, identify hotspots, and inform response efforts. - Health Equity and Disparities: Story maps can highlight health disparities and inequities across different communities and populations, drawing attention to areas with the most significant health challenges and the need for targeted interventions. Story Maps turn data into engaging tales, educate, and rally communities. They’re advocates, educators, and responders all in one. Thematic Maps: Here’s where we paint with data, using colors and symbols to show patterns like disease spread or healthcare access across different places. [Thematic maps] (https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/gisx/resources/thematic-maps.html) in public health are maps that use visual symbols, colors, and patterns to represent specific health-related data or themes within a geographic area. Thematic maps are valuable tools in public health for conveying complex information in a spatial context, allowing researchers, policymakers, and the public to quickly understand and interpret health-related data. Thematic maps in public health are used for a variety of purposes, including: - Visualizing disease prevalence and distribution - Identifying health disparities across different regions or demographic groups - Monitoring disease outbreaks and patterns - Assessing access to healthcare services and resources - Evaluating the impact of public health interventions and policies - Communicating public health information to the general public and stakeholders US Covid Atlas (Source: https://uscovidatlas.org/map) Thematic Maps get straight to the point, showing you who and where are affected by health issues, helping to direct attention and resources effectively. Activity 1.4: After exploring the four spatial visualizations (e.g., story maps, thematic maps, dashboards, and asset maps), it is essential to reflect on their advantages and limitations. Create a list of three advantages and three limitations for each of the four visualizations that we reviewed in this module. For example, you could focus on which visualization is better suited for displaying a place’s historical health trends, analyzing the impact of a pandemic, or explaining the results of a public policy? Which visualization requires some experience with statistics and coding, and which one requires experience with the humanities and storytelling? "],["02-scoping.html", "2 Project Scoping 2.1 Overview 2.2 What’s the Point? 2.3 Refining Goals for SDOH 2.4 Defining Stakeholders 2.5 Project Assessment", " 2 Project Scoping 2.1 Overview By the end of this module, you will: X spatial data visualizations in public health X your stakeholders’ needs Select the best spatial visualization type for your project Think of spatial data visualizations as your bridge to meaningful conversations in public health. Nevertheless, crafting insightful maps, dashboards, or other spatial representations can be challenging, due to both technical and methodological hurdles. The path to creating an effective spatial data visualization does not commence with software usage; rather, it initiates with stakeholder meetings, annotations, and sketches. Therefore, the primary objective of this module is to encourage you to invest time in thinking about your potential visualization and considering the individuals who will reap its benefits. Annotations, sketches, and meeting summaries can be handwritten in a notebook or digitally generated on a computer. We recommend creating a journal for this toolkit to annotate and store your notes. Your toolkit journal will assist you in organizing your thoughts, creating new content, making sketches, saving code, writing notes from meetings, and reflecting on your mapping process. Indeed, the production of relevant visualizations related to SDOH is a lengthy and complex process that requires creativity, organization, and technological skills. Your journal can be an invaluable companion on your journey. Required Tools For this module, you need your toolkit journal: Notebook and writing utensil or Note-taking or sketching app (if you prefer digital annotations) Some of our team members prefer drawing on post-it notes, tablets, digital apps, or wall-sized pieces of paper. Take your pick and go with it! 2.2 What’s the Point? The goal of this project will be to develop some place-based data viz/app/decision support that will integrate social determinants of health and an equity framework. But, what will you, do, specifically — and why? Let’s run through some core questions. Where is your application? Is it within a city, neighborhood, or across an entire country? Greater spatial coverage does not necessarily mean that your project will get more complex. It may be easier to grab data for all communities within a city from a data portal, for example, than extract data for a single neighborhood. Having more areas available for comparison can also be useful. Greater spatial resolution does tend to make projects more complicated, on the other hand. You want to explore state policies for 50 states? No problem. Want to grab census tract data for the entire country (all 77,000)? This will limit your visualization options, as some software approaches will be able to handle it with ease, whereas others not all. Who is your application about — a specific population, defined by their residence and/or some social, economic, or other characteristic? And, Who is your application for? Who will actually be using your application? How and why are they different? Data may not be available for all places and populations. For example, COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity is still not disaggregated below the state-level for all counties in the U.S (!). You may need to start with your ideal, and then work towards what’s actually doable. As this toolkit will encourage more than once, it is helpful to work with persons who will actually use the application, to increase its meaning and utility. At the same time, it is also helpful to work with persons who the data is about, as lived experiences will provide invaluable understanding, depth, and insight into the project of interest. When is your application — are you focused on the most recent datasets you can find, or are you interested in data over many time periods? And, how will the application itself be changed or updated over time? Consider the sustainability and long-term maintenance needs of your project. Where will it be in five years? Would it be okay for the application to exist as a time capsule for a project completed, or do you prefer it to have data updated regularly? What actions should/could result from your application? Are they reasonable, feasible, and time-bound? Do you intend for your interactive asset map of cooling centers to be used by community members during a heat event to find refuge? Are you trying to inspire action from policymakers after exploring your data dashboard of modeled map findings and statistics on health disparities? It is common to start with too ambitious a goal, that will slowly get refined over the project’s course of implementation. Try to be realistic and honest when assessing what your final project could do. Why is it important? Why should people care? This is often the most important question, and the one least formulated in early stages of the process. Something may be interesting and meaningful to you, but may not be important to others. Or it may be very obvious to you and your peers, but the thought hasn’t occurred to others in a different discipline or domain. Be specific and intentional in setting this objective, and do the research. Put these together to generate an overview goal statement for your project. Include the primary question you’re trying to answer. This may change throughout the process, but should be changed to be refined further, rather than expanded in scope. Think of the start of your project as setting out on a road trip. First, you need to map out where you want to go. What do you hope to discover along the way? Your visualization techniques are like choosing the right vehicle for the journey—each has its strengths for different terrains. Your goals will evolve as you travel, finding new paths to explore. But it all starts with a clear destination in mind. 2.3 Refining Goals for SDOH Taking your project a step further, dig deeper into how your application can address SDOH directly. Which common approach or technique is the most pertinent to your goals? Consider the following ideas: Identifying Health Disparities You can employ spatial visualizations to identify areas with disproportionate health burdens and disparities. For example, by mapping health outcomes and demographic data from the census, it could become evident which communities or populations experience higher rates of diseases or poor health, shedding light on potential health inequities. Targeting Interventions Another option is performing spatial analyses to target interventions and resources to areas with the greatest need. By creating asset maps, you could aid public health advocates to direct their efforts, and allocate resources to address health disparities and promote equity. Assessing Access to Healthcare You can produce maps to evaluate the accessibility of healthcare services across different regions. These cartographies identify areas with limited access to medical facilities or services, which is crucial in understanding barriers to healthcare for marginalized populations and addressing health disparities. Modeling SDOH at Different Scales You can produce geostatistical analyses to model how social determinants of health (SODH) affect communities at different scales. By studying and mapping these factors, you may better understand how social conditions influence health outcomes and equity. Environmental Justice You could create a dashboard to assess environmental health risks and exposures. By combining graphs, maps, and tables you may identify areas with environmental hazards that disproportionately affect specific communities, contributing to health disparities. Health Planning and Policy Interventions Your maps can inform stakeholders in their efforts to create effective policies. By deploying various spatial visualizations, you can support interventions targeting specific health challenges in various communities, ultimately promoting health equity. Community Engagement Story maps or collaborative mapping projects may facilitate community engagement by providing social experience insights. These representations allow community members to participate in decision-making, voice their concerns, and collaborate with public health officials to design interventions that address their unique needs and concerns. Monitoring and Evaluation Spatio-temporal dashboards are effective tools to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. By comparing health outcomes before and after implementing interventions, public health officials can assess whether disparities are decreasing and health equity is improving. Take a moment to consider which goal(s) you have for your project. We recommend starting simple, with no more than one or two goals to start with. Your initial project should focus on accomplishing your primary goal to the greatest of your abilities. Over time, more experience, resources, and support will enable you and your team to expand further. Common Goals for SDOH &amp; Place Applications Goal Description Identifying Health Disparities Map health outcomes &amp; demographics to identify disparities. Targeting Interventions Use spatial analysis to direct resources effectively. Assess Access to Healthcare Map service accessibility to pinpoint healthcare gaps. Modeling SDOH at Different Scales Analyze SDOH imapct across scales for insight into health influences. Environmental Justice Create dashboards to monitor enviornmental health risks. Health Planning &amp; Policy Interventions Inform policy with visualizations to address health challenges. Community Engagement Use story maps to involve communities in decision-making. Monitoring and Evaluation Track interventions over time with spatio-temporal dashboards. 2.3.1 Integrate Equity Directly Think back to the equity framework introduced in the first module. While each component is critical to any application built to understand and communicate SDOH, the Content of Equity component can be a useful consideration when building into your goals. Consider how your application may address equity by focusing on one or more of these aspects. Some examples include: Integrating community stakeholders directly to the decision-making processes, planning, and implementation of your web application. (Procedural Equity) Developing an asset map of local health and social services to maximize networking and connection in your city. (Distributive Equity) Curating a story map that invites users to “walk” through a neighborhood over time as it becomes segregated from highway construction. (Contextual Equity) 2.3.2 Activity Take a look at these three real-world projects. In your own words, sketch out their goals. Do they align with any of the SDOH application goals we’ve mapped above? What content of equity (procedural, distributive, or contextual) do they address? Data and Stats | Tulsa Health Department United States of Health Dashboard | McKinsey &amp; Company Heart Disease Death Rates Aged 35 and older, Total Population | cdc.gov Next, update your own goal statement based on ideas in this section. What are your SDOH and Equity goals? 2.3.3 Project Tip Module 1 is just the beginning of a process. To keep progressing, it’s essential to always look for inspiration and stakeholders. Take some time to explore various web maps, dashboards, atlases, magazines, and academic articles. Then, list the ones you find appealing in your journal. Even if they are spatial visualizations that have nothing to do with health, try to imagine how you can use their design to study SDOH. 2.4 Defining Stakeholders Once you’ve got your project’s goals on the horizon, it’s time to look at who’s journeying with you. Collaboration and stakeholder identification are vital components of any project that aims to achieve equity. Whether it’s a non-governmental organization, a research group within a university, or a government agency, stakeholders bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the table. Similarly, communities, activists, and advocates can also play a significant role in your project’s success. Early identification of stakeholders is key to building trust and solidarity, which is a time-consuming but necessary process. In Module 2, we will delve deeper into employing User-Centered Design to engage stakeholders effectively. The aim will be to ensure that every step of the project, from conception to implementation, is done in collaboration with those who have a vested interest in the outcomes, guaranteeing that the resulting initiatives are equitable, impactful, and sustainable. For now, let’s assess your team. 2.4.1 Assess Your Team Take an inventory of who makes up your team, and define each person’s role. If you are embedded within a larger organization or corporation, there may be expansive stakeholders involved, with multiple stages of review, implementation, and iteration. If you’re in a smaller group or you’re on your own, you may be taking on several roles at the same time. Your core team may include community members directly, or may have a different leadership structure. Here are some critical roles to consider: Responsibilities Description Set Strategy, Priorities, &amp; Standards Core Team, Leadership Allocate Resources (Time and $) Leadership Manage Processes Core Team, Project Manager Design, Research Use Cases Core Team, Designer Develop, Deploy, &amp; Monitor Project Core Team, Engineer Use the application in way that was expected Expected Users Use the application in way that was uexpected Unexpected Users There are two additional stakeholders every application developer should consider – the Champion, and the Curmudgeon. Yes, these are actual roles that have been used in Health Informatics teaching for some time… Considering them will be essential for your success: The Champion - They love your idea, sing its praises, and are ready to share your work with everyone they know. They may not get the “tech stuff” completely, and won’t have time to learn it if they wanted to, but are your biggest cheerleader. They may help you get funding. The Curmudgeon - They prefer to do things the way they have always been doing it. It’s generally something they do themselves, and probably manually. They are not interested in your work, and may challenge it with a sigh, eye-roll, or outright lament. May prefer technology the way it “used” to be. We caution that you not shift your work too much in either direction to please/antagonize either of these stakeholders, but rather understand their role in the process at this stage. 2.4.2 Motivations If you find yourself to be a “curmudgeon” at the idea of working with others to support your journey, we also encourage you to take a moment to consider all the benefits of engaging more stakeholders. Here’s how a wider stakeholder alliance can shape your journey: Understanding Diverse Perspectives: Stakeholders come from various backgrounds and sectors, each bringing unique insights that can challenge and enrich your project’s approach to health. A government official might understand policy implications, while a local activist might provide a grassroots perspective on community health challenges. Data Gathering and Validation: Collaborators are crucial in both collecting and validating SDOH data. They ensure that the information reflects real-world conditions and is relevant to the communities affected. Researchers can provide rigorous methodologies, while community members can offer qualitative insights that ground the data in lived experiences. Expanding the Network: Engaging with stakeholders allows for the expansion of your network. Each stakeholder may introduce you to other relevant parties, broadening the reach and potential impact of your project. This can lead to discovering untapped resources or finding new avenues for support and advocacy. Exploring New Contexts: Stakeholders can act as guides through unfamiliar territories, both metaphorically in the project domain and literally in the community spaces. They help navigate the cultural, social, and political landscapes that shape health outcomes. Innovative Co-Design: Utilizing User-Centered Design principles, stakeholders become co-creators in developing spatial visualizations that represent SDOH. Their input ensures that the end products are not only technically sound but also culturally sensitive and user-friendly. Forging Partnerships: Collaboration can lead to long-term partnerships that extend beyond the life of a single project. These relationships can build a foundation for future initiatives, creating a sustainable impact on public health. Revising Project Goals:** Stakeholders often provide new insights that can lead to a reframing of project goals. What begins as a narrow focus on a particular health issue might evolve into a more holistic approach that considers a wider range of social factors. Ensuring Equity: By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, the project is more likely to address equity in a meaningful way. Equity is not just about equal access, it’s also about designing interventions that acknowledge and address power imbalances and historical contexts that contribute to health disparities. 2.4.3 Finding a Community of Practice Even if you think you’re getting into this solo or with a smaller team, you may be surprised at the number of people available to connect with you as invaluable colleagues, future friends, and mentors in your network. You’ve found this project – that already means you’re a part of a wider community of practice. Join our LinkedIn and GitHub pages to introduce yourself and expand your network. Not sure where to start looking for mentors? We love this Mentor Map exercise by the National Center for Faculty Development &amp; Diversity – not just for academic folks, but anyone who has a beating heart and is working on a project. Try out the exercise yourself to identify persons in your network who you may be reach out to connect for feedback, accountability, intellectual discussions, and emotional support as you work through the project. 2.4.4 Activity Review these two projects and identify their stakeholders. Explain what is their role in each project. Urban Youths Go 3000 Miles: Engaging and Supporting Young Residents to Conduct Neighborhood Asset Mapping | AJPH Food assets for whom? Community perspectives on food asset mapping in Canada 2.5 Project Assessment You now know what you want to do, and who you want to do it with. You’ve gathered your team and had a few good discussions. If you’re on your own, you’ve made a list of mentors and additional resources to connect with so you can ensure feedback throughout the process. Let’s finish scoping this project. 2.5.1 Assess Your Strengths Each project will require domain expertise and technical capacity. Domain expertise means knowledge … Technical capacity will refer to … Which is your strength, and which will you need to skill up to further support for project implementation? For example: If your project is about building an asset map to support populations experiencing food insecurity, you may be a food bank volunteer who has worked directly with populations impacted, live in the community, and also would be using the application with collaboration from the regional food pantry network. In this case, you have extensive domain expertise and knowledge that will be more enriched than most web app developers, assuming you are not a developer for your day job. For this project, your goal will be to scale up your technical capacity within the constraints of your setting. On the other hand, perhaps you are a graduate student who has been coding statistical models for your work, and are interested in adding more social impact to your work. You’re used to learning new programming languages for new projects, and have a high technical capacity, but are not embedded within the community you want to build an asset map for. For this project, your goal will be to scale up your understanding of equity based frameworks, learning more about community experiences, as well as researching the topic further to build your domain expertise. After assessing your strengths, go back to your list of stakeholders and update as needed. Note that as your expand your stakeholder team, your project may update according to shared goals and visions of team members. As a result, your team will work through the assessment process more than once. This iterative process is expected. 2.5.2 Assess Project Needs Project Needs will include data, computer services, time, and attitude. To assess this, you will need to survey your motivation and paint points, as well as technical, financial, people, and time resources. Consider sustainability at this stage… 2.5.3 Establish Deliverables Technial requirements ++ application action goals: - Access to information (ex. Drop-down selection, click for pop-up window, scrollytelling) - User-prompted input (ex. Slider, number entry) ++ SMART goals/similar? 2.5.4 Establish Process ++ data preparation, analysis, application development (recommend that just 1 is intensive) Project Manage Generate a timeline, and break out tasks How will you manage &amp; document your process? Communications plan between team members &amp; stakeholders? Agile Processes Module 1 Activity: Think of a problem you want to solve. Write down your purpose and objectives by clearly stating why you want to solve this problem and what you hope to achieve. Who is your target audience? Next, make a list of your potential stakeholders. How would you contact your stakeholders and why would they be interested in collaborating with you? Would you be part of an ongoing project or propose a new one? The format for this exercise is flexible and exploratory. You can opt to create lists of objectives, draw diagrams, write a structured plan, or engage in a free-writing exercise. The primary aim of this task is to develop a foundation to begin exploring spatial data for your project.It’s important to note that your final prototype might diverge significantly from what you record in this entry, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Remember, the process of using SDOH spatial data for visualizations is a dynamic process. Summary of Module 1 In Module 1, the focus is on goal setting for a spatial visualization project related to social determinants of health (SDOH) in public health. Here’s a summary of the key points: Objectives (1.1): - Clarifying project goals is the initial step. - The choice of visualization techniques is closely tied to project objectives. - General goals include identifying health disparities, targeting interventions, assessing access to healthcare, modeling SDOH at different scales, evaluating environmental health, informing health planning and policy, engaging the community, and monitoring and evaluating interventions. Stakeholders (1.2): Collaboration and stakeholder identification are essential for achieving equity. Stakeholders can be organizations, researchers, government agencies, communities, activists, and advocates. Early identification of stakeholders builds trust and solidarity. Spatial Data (1.3): - Social determinants of health encompass conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. - Spatial data is crucial for understanding how communities are affected by their environments. - Three types of spatial data are primary (collected personally), secondary (from databases and census records), and tertiary (previously used in other maps). Data Visualizations (1.4): - Four types of spatial visualizations are discussed: asset maps, data dashboards, story maps, and thematic maps. - Asset maps focus on community strengths and resources. - Data dashboards present health-related data in a user-friendly format. - Story maps combine maps, text, images, and multimedia for storytelling. - Thematic maps use visual symbols to represent specific health-related data or themes within a geographic area. The module also encourages exploring external resources and encourages participants to think about their own project’s purpose, objectives, target audience, and potential stakeholders. It emphasizes that Module 1 is the beginning of a dynamic process in the journey of using spatial data for SDOH visualizations in public health.

This toolkit underscores the fact that social determinants of health encompass more than personal genetics or healthy habits. According to the World Health Organization, social determinants of health refer to the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (https://health.gov/healthypeople, accessed 11 October, 2023 ). By adopting a spatial view of SDOH, we can research how communities are affected by the places they inhabit. For instance, we can evaluate their access to health care, transportation, recreation, and green areas. On the other hand, some communities may be exposed in their neighborhoods to crime, racism, and pollution. By mobilizing spatial visualizations, we can identify and address these inequalities. The spatial data we need for our visualizations can be quite different. While censuses and databases can provide a starting point, it’s important to understand their nature - what they include and what they leave out, who generates them (whether it’s the public or private sector), and what their intended purpose is. Scrutinizing spatial data is critical to start conceiving your spatial visualization. Think of spatial data as your high-powered lens zooming in on a community’s heartbeat. It lets you see beyond the surface to the underlying structures—like healthcare reach, parks, and transport. And yes, it also uncovers the shadows of crime, discrimination, and pollution. In your SDOH project, you can typically use three types of spatial data: primary, secondary, and tertiary. In the following section, we will provide a brief description of each of these types of data. Types of data, (graphic created by Kamaria Barronville) Primary Spatial Data: Primary spatial data refers to the data that you can collect either personally or through a sensor/machine which you or your stakeholders have previously installed. There are several examples of spatial visualizations of SDOH made with primary data. Some researchers have used online interviews or questionnaires to analyze their experiences in their neighborhood. Other researchers have placed sensors to map air quality in cities. The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or smartphones is another way to generate primary data. Secondary Spatial Data: You may encounter challenges when gathering SDOH primary spatial data, as it can be a time-consuming and costly endeavor. As a result, SDOH researchers, mapmakers, and advocates frequently turn to various secondary resources, such as spatial databases and census records, to inform their spatial representations. Typically, these files consist of digital layers that are prepared for seamless incorporation into a GIS or web mapping application. However, you can also work and manipulate non-spatial data in your project. Notable sources for such data include both profit and non-profit databases, government census information, and even digitized or scanned paper maps. Tertiary Spatial Data: In the realm of SDOH spatial visualizations, there exists a third option–your map(s) may access other maps’ spatial data. Tertiary spatial data are spatial layers that have been previously or currently utilized in other cartographies and are readily accessible for integration into a Geographic Information System (GIS) or web mapping applications. When engaging with stakeholders experienced in health mapping, it’s worth inquiring whether they possess any spatial layers that could prove beneficial for your project. It is key to emphasize that data can often be tainted by biases and errors. As a result, the methods used to gather, aggregate, or model spatial data can have adverse effects on the quality of our data visualizations. It is of utmost importance to meticulously scrutinize various forms of data, whether they are qualitative (e..g, interviews or questionnaires), quantitative (e.g., databases), or mixed (e.g., surveys). A valuable starting point for data analysis involves assessing metadata within databases or interview questions. Further insights into this subject will be explored in subsequent sections of this toolkit. Project Tip: In your project, there’s no need to limit yourself to just one kind of data. In fact, it’s not only possible but often necessary to mix and match different sources and types of spatial data to craft compelling SDOH spatial visualizations. Activity 1.3: Review these projects below and identify what type of data they use. In your opinion, what other types of data could they use to enrich their visualizations?
