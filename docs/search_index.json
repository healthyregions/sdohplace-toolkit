HCD is a well-researched framework that ensures the potential users’ desires, abilities, and contexts are at the core of interactive systems and applications. HCD consists of four main steps: identifying users’ needs, designing for those needs, evaluating, and iterating. Inspired by HCD, the Place toolkit is built upon an ongoing co-creation and evaluation process that leverages the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, and analysts. The Place Project Community Toolkit connects equity principles with analysis and design of spatial visualizations for SDOH spatial data. This toolkit draws inspiration from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission’s findings, which assessed how communities’s health and life expectancy are affected by the places where they live. To address this issue, RWJF has previously created resources to promote health equity. Currently, the community toolkit contains six modules. Depending on your project’s objectives, you can opt to undertake either one module or several of them: Module 1 guides users in identifying and formulating their visualization goals, recognizing potential stakeholders, and prioritizing health equity in their planning. Module 2 emphasizes the importance of user-centered design principles in spatial visualization and evaluates various engagement strategies with stakeholders. Module 3 focuses on the integration of spatial data into projects, covering data-wrangling methods, technologies, and the role of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in spatial visualization. Module 4 delves into the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis in the context of social determinants of health (SDOH). Module 5 introduces users to multiple low or no-code applications for creating mapping visualizations. These open-source applications concentrate on four cartographic approaches for mapping SDOH: story maps, asset maps, thematic maps, and data dashboards. Module 6 addresses how users can evaluate and disseminate their SDOH mapping projects, underscoring the importance of ongoing stakeholder engagement.
