[["index.html", "The SDOH &amp; Place Community Toolkit Preface", " The SDOH &amp; Place Community Toolkit Preface The SDOH &amp; Place Project Community Toolkit aims to increase the capacity for community and civic organizations in health to: Access and work with social determinants of health (SDOH) data (i.e., place/spatial data) Use place data for social good and to further health equity Develop engaging and compelling apps to inspire, activate, and retain users Work within an open ecosystem infrastructure The SDOH &amp; Place Project Community Toolkit connects equity principles with analysis and design of spatial visualizations for SDOH spatial data. This toolkit draws inspiration from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission’s findings, which assessed how communities’s health and life expectancy are affected by the places where they live. To address this issue, RWJF has previously created resources to promote health equity. In order to identify and engage with the necessities of different social actors, the community toolkit is based on the principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD). HCD is a well-researched framework that ensures the potential users’ desires, abilities, and contexts are at the core of interactive systems and applications. HCD consists of four main steps: identifying users’ needs, designing for those needs, evaluating, and iterating. Inspired by HCD, the community toolkit is built upon an ongoing co-creation and evaluation process that leverages the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, and analysts. Table of Contents Currently, the community toolkit contains six modules. Depending on your project’s objectives, you can opt to undertake either one module or several of them. We recommend starting with Modules 1-3 regardless, and choosing your own adventure in subsequent chapters. Module 1 explores SDOH, equity, and types of visualizations. (Led by Kamaria Barronville, José Alavez, and Marynia Kolak) Module 2 guides users in identifying and formulating their visualization goals, recognizing potential stakeholders, and prioritizing health equity in their planning. (Led by Kamaria Barronville, José Alavez, and Marynia Kolak) Module 3 emphasizes the importance of user-centered design principles in spatial visualization and evaluates various engagement strategies with stakeholders. (Led by Shubham Kumar and José Alavez) Module 4 focuses on the integration of spatial data into projects, covering data-wrangling methods, technologies, and the role of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in spatial visualization. (Led by José Alavez and Marynia Kolak) Module 5 delves into the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis in the context of social determinants of health (SDOH). (Led by José Alavez, Kamaria Barronville, and Marynia Kolak ) Module 6 introduces users to multiple low or no-code applications for creating mapping visualizations. These open-source applications concentrate on four cartographic approaches for mapping SDOH: story maps, asset maps, thematic maps, and data dashboards. (Led by Catherine Discenza) Module 7 addresses how users can evaluate and disseminate their SDOH mapping projects, underscoring the importance of ongoing stakeholder engagement.

"],["01-intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 SDOH &amp; Place 1.2 Centering Equity 1.3 Dynamic Spatial Visualizations 1.4 Types of (Spatial) Applications Resources", " 1 Introduction Objectives In this module, you will: Expand your understanding of the social determinants of health and equity Learn how spatial data visualizations are used in public health Define four main types of web mapping applications By the end, you should have an idea of which type of spatial data visualization type you plan to work with for your project. Think of spatial data visualizations as your bridge to meaningful conversations in public health. Nevertheless, crafting insightful maps, dashboards, or other spatial representations can be challenging, due to both technical and methodological hurdles. The path to creating an effective spatial data visualization does not commence with software usage; rather, it initiates with stakeholder meetings, annotations, and sketches. Therefore, a objective of this toolkit is to encourage you to invest time in thinking about your potential visualization and considering the individuals who will reap its benefits. Annotations, sketches, and meeting summaries can be handwritten in a notebook or digitally generated on a computer. We recommend creating a journal for this toolkit to annotate and store your notes. Your toolkit journal will assist you in organizing your thoughts, creating new content, making sketches, saving code, writing notes from meetings, and reflecting on your mapping process. Indeed, the production of relevant visualizations related to SDOH is a lengthy and complex process that requires creativity, organization, and technological skills. Your journal can be an invaluable companion on your journey. Tools For this toolkit, you need your toolkit journal: Notebook and writing utensil or Note-taking or sketching app (if you prefer digital annotations) Some of our team members prefer drawing on post-it notes, tablets, digital apps, or wall-sized pieces of paper. Take your pick and go with it! 1.1 SDOH &amp; Place When we talk about the factors that shape our health, it’s not just about biology or lifestyle — it’s about where we live and the complex tapestry of history, society, and economy that frames our lives. The social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass a range of historical, social, cultural, political, and economic factors that significantly impact the well-being of individuals and their communities. These SDOH aren’t just statistics; they’re stories of communities and the places we call home, varying from one street to the next. They’re about whether we have parks over parking lots, fresh food on shelves, and whether our neighborhoods are marked by support or segregation. Figure 1.1 - Classic representations of the SDOH. Source: K. Baronville The social determinants of health are complex and exist at many different scales — the individual, interpersonal, community, and regional levels. In this toolkit, we focus on how the SDOH emerge at community and regional levels. For example, neighborhoods will have differing availability of fresh produce, community clinics, and job opportunities, impacting how residents are able to successfully eat healthy, visit health providers, and afford housing essentials. By using neighborhood or regional scales of data to approximate SDOH, we can begin to get a deeper sense of the complex environment in which people live, work, and play. When working with measures at neighborhood-levels, a spatial view is essential to enable us to work with the data, from data wrangling to visualization and analysis. A neighborhood-view of SDOH is multidimensional, and can predict over 60% of premature deaths. Academics, activists, government agents, and policymakers have employed data visualizations to examine the connections between places and SDOH. For example, they have utilized dashboards to study the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities. They implemented participatory mapping to advocate for policy-based interventions, and deployed story maps to promote health initiatives. To produce these data visualizations, health researchers and advocates mobilize a wide array of conceptual frameworks and diverse technical skill sets. Moreover, data visualizations in public health do not only analyze the relationship between places and SDOH. They promote health equity: “a state in which everyone has a fair and equitable opportunity to achieve their highest level of health” (CDC’s Office of Health Equity, 2022). 1.2 Centering Equity The concept of equity in public health data visualizations goes beyond mere stylistic enhancements to aid in comprehension or research. It extends to encompass connections to pertinent resources and diverse language options, for example, empowering communities with information, processes, and agency to transform, advocate for, and influence residents, neighborhoods, and broader political, economic, and social structures towards healthier systems. Let’s dive deeper into how we can make data visualizations not just informative, but also inclusive and impactful. You see, it’s not all about graphs and numbers. By weaving in stories and multimedia—like videos and interactive media streams—we open up a world where data talks to everyone, not just to those who love statistics. Imagine a dashboard that not only shows you the trends but also tells you the stories behind the numbers. It’s designed with real people in mind, adapting to a variety of preferences—whether you’re someone who loves a good narrative or someone who digs deep into the data. However, we’ve got to acknowledge that sometimes, our public health systems fall short. They miss the mark on painting the full picture of health disparities. That’s why, when we’re talking about Place &amp; SDOH, we need to put equity at the heart of our work—from the word go, right through to the final pixel of the design. It’s not just a ‘nice-to-have’; it’s a must-do for visualizations that truly resonate with and serve all communities. Equity Orientation The equity orientation in a public health data system involves several key components that must be outlined to address health disparities and promote equitable outcomes effectively. These components include: Setting Parameters of Equity: Decision-Making Inclusion: The process of setting parameters for equity should involve diverse stakeholders, including representatives from marginalized communities, to ensure that the perspectives and needs of all affected populations are considered. Target Population: It is crucial to identify the specific populations and communities that are the focus of efforts to improve equity. This includes recognizing vulnerable groups that historically experience disparities in health outcomes. Focus on Equity: Differential Needs: An equity-oriented approach acknowledges that different populations have varying needs and histories. It recognizes the importance of tailoring interventions to address these disparities rather than assuming that a one-size-fits-all approach will be sufficient. Addressing Historical Considerations: An equity-oriented system acknowledges historical injustices and systemic discrimination that have contributed to current health disparities. It seeks to redress these past injustices and provide opportunities for affected communities to improve their health and well-being. Subject of Equity: Inclusivity: The subject of equity encompasses all individuals and communities facing health disparities, including marginalized and underserved groups. Generational and Historical Considerations: An equity-oriented data system takes into account intergenerational and historical factors that have contributed to health disparities. It recognizes that current health outcomes are influenced by past policies and practices. Content of Equity: Procedural Equity: This aspect of equity focuses on ensuring that the decision-making processes and procedures are perceived as fair and transparent. It involves involving affected communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions. Distributive Equity: Distributive equity concerns how social welfare and resources are distributed to meet the needs of different populations. It aims to allocate resources in a way that reduces health disparities and provides equitable access to healthcare and other essential services. Contextual Equity: This aspect acknowledges that pre-existing social conditions (such as poverty, discrimination, and access to resources) influence equity. An equity-oriented data system considers these contextual factors when designing interventions to address health disparities effectively.

Embracing a Trauma-Informed Mindset in Decision-Making Adopting a trauma-informed mindset is crucial for creating solutions that are sensitive, empathetic, and inclusive when working in the space of communicating, understanding, and analyzing. Trauma-informed decision-making ensures that your project respects the experiences and well-being of individuals whose data is being visualized. Here are key considerations to guide your decision-making process with a trauma-informed approach: Understand the Impact of Trauma: Recognize that individuals within your data may have experienced trauma, whether it’s related to health disparities, socioeconomic challenges, or other adverse life events. Understanding the potential impact of trauma allows you to approach your project with empathy and compassion. Prioritize Safety and Trust: Safety and trust are foundational elements of trauma-informed care. Ensure that your data visualization project creates a safe and trustworthy space for users. This involves transparent communication, data security measures, and a user-friendly interface that minimizes potential triggers. Promote Choice and Empowerment: Empower users by providing choices in how they interact with and interpret the data. Consider customizable features that allow individuals to tailor their experience based on their preferences. This promotes a sense of agency and control over their engagement with the visualization. Avoid Re-traumatization: Strive to avoid re-traumatization through your data visualizations. Be mindful of the language used, the visual elements displayed, and the overall tone of your project. Aim to present information in a way that informs without causing distress or harm. Cultural Sensitivity and Diversity: Acknowledge and integrate cultural sensitivity into your decision-making process. Consider the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences of the individuals represented in the data. Ensure that your visualizations are inclusive and respectful of different cultural perspectives. Engage Stakeholders and Communities: Involve stakeholders and communities in the decision-making process. Seek input from those directly impacted by the data being visualized. Community engagement ensures that your project aligns with the real needs and concerns of the people it serves. Continuous Feedback Loops: Establish continuous feedback loops to gather insights from users and stakeholders. Regularly reassess your decision-making processes in light of the feedback received, allowing for ongoing improvement and adaptation to the evolving needs of the community. Ethical Data Use and Privacy: Uphold ethical standards in data use and privacy protection. Clearly communicate how data will be used, ensuring transparency and obtaining informed consent when necessary. Respect privacy rights and prioritize the responsible and ethical handling of sensitive information. By embracing a trauma-informed mindset in decision-making, your SDOH data visualization project can contribute to a more compassionate and understanding approach to public health. This mindset not only enhances the user experience but also promotes a positive impact on the well-being of the individuals and communities represented in the data. Tip Consider your audience or who your project will impact. How can you involve them in the entire process of developing and disseminating your project? Start by creating a list of people you know that can be included, think about who they can connect you to. Ask if they’re willing to contribute some of their time and expertise to help you develop this project. View the people your working with as co-creators. 1.3 Dynamic Spatial Visualizations Visualizing public health data isn’t just about the “what”—it’s about the “so what?” It’s about crafting digital narratives that anyone can access, understand, and use to make a difference. These visual tools are our digital megaphones and meeting places—they bring us together, keep us informed, and push us towards action. Data visualizations in public health that advance equity are digital tools designed to provide accessible and comprehensive data related to public health indicators, focusing on reducing health disparities and promoting equity among different populations. These tools often combine various data sources and visualization techniques to present information in a user-friendly and easily understandable format. Because of our focus on SDOH &amp; Place at neighborhood and regional levels, we’ll focus on spatial data visualizations. Spatial data visualizations incorporate not just the “regular” data, but in addition, how that data is linked to places. This new dimension of data can be visualized as a map. But another important aspect emerges; with spatial data, we are given the ability to link any data by location. This enables us to integrate the many facets of SDOH and health, converging on place. Figure 1.2 - In this dashboard, clicking on a location launches an interactive infographic of detailed health outcomes. Source: Appsilon Data visualizations can be used by community members and organizations, research groups, policymakers, and more to empower individuals to better access and mobilize SDOH data and advance health equity. Within the realm of public health, maps, dashboards, and interactive web applications can be created to foster fairness through an inclusive design that accommodates diverse user groups and their varying degrees of health equity. These tools are not only visually appealing and easy to comprehend, they also provide valuable insights. They adapt to the needs of different social actors by combining well-suited graphics, animations, and audio-visual elements. They even offer networking tools (e.g., messaging boards) for seamless data exchange and user interaction. These interactive features also serve to promptly update users about any alterations. Figure 1.3 - Health initiatives across Greece are shared as an interactive storymap. Source: The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Tip We use the term spatial data visualizations throughout the toolkit. We are focusing on web-based applications that will have some interactions. (In other words, they’re not just pictures.) There are many other names for what we’re talking about, like: Web Applications Mapping Applications Spatial Decision Support Systems We’re not covering all types of spatial data visualizations, or all web apps, but will focus on common types of web mapping applications. 1.4 Types of (Spatial) Applications Throughout this module, we’ve concentrated on orienting you to how we talk about SDOH and Place, given you a change to brainstorm ideas, recognize prospective stakeholders, and consider potential data at your disposal for your project As we progress, we will now examine how these three features converge when it comes to choosing an appropriate spatial visualization. To facilitate this, we will introduce four distinct types of spatial visualizations for communicating about and investigating the social determinants of health: asset maps, thematic maps, story maps, and dashboards. When comparing spatial visualization options, we’ll focus on two dimensions: 1) map type, and 2) level of data &amp; interaction complexity. For map type, visualizations may be more of a reference or thematic map. A reference map is meant to emphasize information about locations, whereas a thematic map will focus on geographic patterns of a specific topic. Interaction complexity refers to the intensity and variability of user interaction with the visualization. The interactions may involve a click to open an information window, or may require extensive decision-making and careful parameter selection to generate a updated visualization. Data complexity my refer to how many types of data you are incorporating, from different forms of spatial data (e.g. address-level locations, community boundaries) as well as different types of input data (e.g. photos, videos, tabular data). As applications get more complex, you can also have lines blurred across both dimensions. Figure 1.5 - Types of Spatial Data Visualizations an Web Mapping Applications. Source: HEROP Lab Team Asset Maps These are like your community’s highlight reel, showcasing everything from the vibrant parks and schools to the people who make your area tick. They’re about celebrating what’s there, not just what’s missing, and sparking conversations about building on those strengths. Asset maps act as reference maps and tend towards straightforward interactions, like clicking on an icon to access details about an address. Data-wise, asset maps will start with address-level locations, that will get converted to point data. Figure 1.6 Community Food Map as an Asset Map, Source: University of Illinois Asset mapping may involve engaging with community members, stakeholders, and local organizations to gather information and collaboratively build the map. The process can be facilitated through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and public meetings. Alternatively, you may link existing data about resources into a newly integrated platform. The resulting asset map is a visual tool that provides a comprehensive view of the community’s strengths, potential partnerships, and areas where support and resources are available. The assets included in an asset map can be diverse and encompass various categories, such as: Physical Assets: These include tangible resources like parks, schools, hospitals, community centers, libraries, public transportation, and other infrastructure elements. Human Assets: Human resources within the community, such as skilled individuals, volunteers, community leaders, and organizations’ staff, are valuable assets. Social Assets: Social assets refer to the networks, relationships, and social capital present in the community, including support systems, cultural groups, and community organizations. Economic Assets: These include businesses, local enterprises, job opportunities, and other economic resources that contribute to the community’s well-being. Cultural Assets: The cultural assets encompass the traditions, heritage, arts, and cultural events that enrich the community’s identity and cohesion. Environmental Assets: Natural resources, green spaces, environmental initiatives, and sustainable practices are considered environmental assets. Asset Maps empower communities, steer strategic planning, and guide resource allocation. They’re about networking and flipping the script to a more positive community narrative. Simple Thematic Maps Here’s where we paint with data, using colors and symbols to show patterns like disease spread or healthcare access across different places. Thematic maps in public health are maps that use visual symbols, colors, and patterns to represent specific health-related data or themes within a geographic area. Data-wise, thematic maps use area boundaries, like census tracts or counties, referred to as polygon data. Statistical data in CSV formats are merged to spatial data boundaries. Data &amp; interaction complexity remain more simplified, encouraging the user to inspect visualized patterns. Interactions may include selecting different variables for different maps, or clicking on an area to get information in a pop-up window. Figure 1.7 - Mapping Climate Risks by County and Community (Source: Pinkus 2021, via the American Communities Project) Thematic maps are valuable tools in public health for conveying complex information in a spatial context, allowing researchers, policymakers, and the public to quickly understand and interpret health-related data. Simple thematic maps in public health are used for a variety of purposes, including: Visualizing disease prevalence and distribution Identifying health disparities across different regions or demographic groups Monitoring disease outbreaks and patterns Assessing access to healthcare services and resources Evaluating the impact of public health interventions and policies Communicating public health information to the general public and stakeholders Simple thematic maps get straight to the point, showing you who and where are affected by health issues, helping to direct attention and resources effectively. Story Maps A story map in public health is a powerful and interactive tool that combines maps, text, images, and multimedia elements to tell a compelling narrative about health-related issues, initiatives, or research. Data and interactions may be gorgeously complex, encouraging users to fully imbibe. Different types of spatial data may be used, from point-based locations to regional views. These are your digital storybooks, weaving maps with tales and images that take you on a journey through health challenges and triumphs. It allows public health professionals to present complex data, trends, and information in a visually engaging and accessible manner, making it easier for a wide range of audiences to understand and connect with the subject matter. Figure 1.8 - The Mapping of Race in America (Hessler et al 2023) Key features and uses of story maps in public health include: Data Visualization: Story maps use maps and data visualizations to illustrate health-related trends, patterns, and disparities across geographic regions. This can include disease prevalence, access to healthcare, environmental health risks, and other relevant data. Narrative Communication: Story maps are structured to present information in a storytelling format. Public health professionals can use narrative elements to explain the context, significance, and implications of the data, helping the audience grasp the larger story behind the statistics. Health Education and Promotion: Story maps are an effective educational tool to raise awareness about public health issues, promote healthy behaviors, and disseminate health-related information to the public. Community Engagement: Story maps can engage communities in public health initiatives by presenting data and insights in a way that is relevant and relatable to specific geographic areas or demographics. Policy Advocacy: Public health professionals can use story maps to advocate for specific policy changes by visualizing the impact of current policies and proposing evidence-based solutions. Environmental Health: Story maps can be used to communicate information about environmental health hazards, pollution, and their impact on public health. They can also showcase initiatives aimed at improving environmental conditions and public health outcomes. Outbreak Response and Preparedness: Story maps can be utilized during disease outbreaks to track the spread of infections, identify hotspots, and inform response efforts. Health Equity and Disparities: Story maps can highlight health disparities and inequities across different communities and populations, drawing attention to areas with the most significant health challenges and the need for targeted interventions. Story Maps turn data into engaging tales, educate, and rally communities. They’re advocates, educators, and responders all in one. Multivariate Data Dashboards Imagine your health community’s stats brought to life in real-time – a dashboard that’s part control panel, part story, helping everyone from officials to neighbors make sense of the numbers. Multiple variables will be integrated across different views, enabling a multivariate experience. Interactions can be complex, requiring user input to change figures or update sliders. Data may also be complex, although will mainly focus on statistical tabular data (rather than multimedia formats). In public health, data dashboards are digital tools that provide visual representations of key health-related data and indicators. Here’s an example of a dashboard that highlights users stories, New Video Series: Moving from Data to Action | City Health Dashboard. These dashboards are specifically designed to present public health data in a user-friendly and easily understandable format, enabling stakeholders, policymakers, researchers, and the general public to access and interpret critical information about population health. Figure 1.8 - The data dashboard was a commonly used tool during the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate community spread and different dimensions of vulnerability. Source: The US Covid Atlas Data dashboards in public health typically include the following features: Health Indicators: Dashboards display a variety of health indicators, such as disease rates, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, hospitalization rates, environmental health data, and other relevant metrics. Geospatial Data: Many public health dashboards utilize spatial data to present geostatistical analysis in real-time, allowing users to understand health patterns and disparities across different geographic regions. Time Series Data: Dashboards often provide data over time, allowing users to observe trends, track changes, and identify seasonal patterns in health outcomes. Demographic Disaggregation: Public health data dashboards may disaggregate data by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This helps identify disparities and understand how health outcomes vary among different population groups. Comparisons and Benchmarks: Dashboards may include the ability to compare health outcomes across regions, states, or countries, as well as against national or global benchmarks. Data Sources and References: Transparent dashboards typically provide information about the sources of data, data collection methods, and references to ensure data credibility. Interactivity: Interactive elements allow users to customize the dashboard, apply filters, and explore data based on their specific interests and questions. Alerts and Notifications: Some dashboards include alerting features to notify users about significant changes in health indicators or emerging health threats. Spatial Data Dashboards keep a pulse on public health, from tracking diseases to zooming in on health equity. They’re transparent, interactive, and always on the lookout with alerts. Activity After exploring the four spatial visualizations (e.g., story maps, thematic maps, dashboards, and asset maps), it is essential to reflect on their advantages and limitations. Create a list of three advantages and three limitations for each of the four visualizations that we reviewed in this module. For example, you could focus on which visualization is better suited for displaying a place’s historical health trends, analyzing the impact of a pandemic, or explaining the results of a public policy? Which visualization requires some experience with statistics and coding, and which one requires experience with the humanities and storytelling?

That may be a series of documents, spreadsheets, or templates identified across online resources. 2.1 What’s the Point? The goal of this project will be to develop some place-based data visualization or application support that will integrate social determinants of health and an equity framework. But, what will you do, specifically — and why? Let’s run through some core questions. Where is your application? Is it within a city, neighborhood, or across an entire country? Greater spatial coverage does not necessarily mean that your project will get more complex. It may be easier to grab data for all communities within a city from a data portal, for example, than extract data for a single neighborhood. Having more areas available for comparison can also be useful. Greater spatial resolution does tend to make projects more complicated, on the other hand. You want to explore state policies for 50 states? No problem. Want to grab census tract data for the entire country (all 77,000)? This will limit your visualization options, as some software approaches will be able to handle it with ease, whereas others not all. Who is your application about — a specific population, defined by their residence and/or some social, economic, or other characteristic? And, Who is your application for? Who will actually be using your application? How and why are they different? Pitfall Data may not be available for all places and populations. For example, COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity is still not disaggregated below the state-level for all counties in the U.S (!). You may need to start with your ideal, and then work towards what’s actually doable. As this toolkit will highlight more than once–it is helpful to work with persons who will actually use the application, to increase its meaning and utility. At the same time, it is also helpful to work with persons who the data is about, as lived experiences will provide invaluable understanding, depth, and insight into the project of interest. When is your application being used? Are you focused on the most recent datasets you can find, or are you interested in data over many time periods? And, how will the application itself be changed or updated over time? Consider the sustainability and long-term maintenance needs of your project. Where will it be in five years? Would it be okay for the application to exist as a time capsule for a project completed, or do you prefer it to have data updated regularly? What actions should/could result from your application? Are they reasonable, feasible, and time-bound? Do you intend for your interactive asset map of cooling centers to be used by community members during a heat event to find refuge? Are you trying to inspire action from policymakers after exploring your data dashboard of modeled map findings and statistics on health disparities? It is common to start with too ambitious a goal, that will slowly get refined over the project’s course of implementation. Try to be realistic and honest when assessing what your final project could do. Why should people care? This is often the most important question, and the one least formulated in early stages of the process. Something may be interesting and meaningful to you, but may not be important to others. Or it may be very obvious to you and your peers, but the thought hasn’t occurred to others in a different discipline or domain. Be specific and intentional in setting this objective, and do the research. Put these together to generate an overview goal statement for your project. Include the primary question you’re trying to answer. This may change throughout the process, but should be changed to be refined further, rather than expanded in scope. Think of the start of your project as setting out on a road trip. First, you need to map out where you want to go. What do you hope to discover along the way? Your visualization techniques are like choosing the right vehicle for the journey—each has its strengths for different terrains. Your goals will evolve as you travel, finding new paths to explore. But it all starts with a clear destination in mind. 2.2 Refining Goals for SDOH Taking your project a step further, dig deeper into how your application can address SDOH directly. Which common approach or technique is the most pertinent to your goals? Consider the following ideas: Identifying Health Disparities You can employ spatial visualizations to identify areas with disproportionate health burdens and disparities. For example, by mapping health outcomes and demographic data from the census, it could become evident which communities or populations experience higher rates of diseases or poor health, shedding light on potential health inequities. Targeting Interventions Another option is performing spatial analyses to target interventions and resources to areas with the greatest need. By creating asset maps, you could aid public health advocates to direct their efforts, and allocate resources to address health disparities and promote equity. Assessing Access to Healthcare You can produce maps to evaluate the accessibility of healthcare services across different regions. These cartographies identify areas with limited access to medical facilities or services, which is crucial in understanding barriers to healthcare for marginalized populations and addressing health disparities. Modeling SDOH at Different Scales You can produce geostatistical analyses to model how social determinants of health (SODH) affect communities at different scales. By studying and mapping these factors, you may better understand how social conditions influence health outcomes and equity. Environmental Justice You could create a dashboard to assess environmental health risks and exposures. By combining graphs, maps, and tables you may identify areas with environmental hazards that disproportionately affect specific communities, contributing to health disparities. Health Planning and Policy Interventions Your maps can inform stakeholders in their efforts to create effective policies. By deploying various spatial visualizations, you can support interventions targeting specific health challenges in various communities, ultimately promoting health equity. Community Engagement Story maps or collaborative mapping projects may facilitate community engagement by providing social experience insights. These representations allow community members to participate in decision-making, voice their concerns, and collaborate with public health officials to design interventions that address their unique needs and concerns. Monitoring and Evaluation Spatio-temporal dashboards are effective tools to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. By comparing health outcomes before and after implementing interventions, public health officials can assess whether disparities are decreasing and health equity is improving. Take a moment to consider which goal(s) you have for your project. We recommend starting simple, with no more than one or two goals to start with. Your initial project should focus on accomplishing your primary goal to the greatest of your abilities. Over time, more experience, resources, and support will enable you and your team to expand further. Common Goals for SDOH &amp; Place Applications Goal Description Identifying Health Disparities Map health outcomes &amp; demographics to identify disparities. Targeting Interventions Use spatial analysis to direct resources effectively. Assess Access to Healthcare Map service accessibility to pinpoint healthcare gaps. Modeling SDOH at Different Scales Analyze SDOH imapct across scales for insight into health influences. Environmental Justice Create dashboards to monitor enviornmental health risks. Health Planning &amp; Policy Interventions Inform policy with visualizations to address health challenges. Community Engagement Use story maps to involve communities in decision-making. Monitoring and Evaluation Track interventions over time with spatio-temporal dashboards. Integrate Equity Directly Think back to the equity framework introduced in the first module. While each component is critical to any application built to understand and communicate SDOH, the Content of Equity component can be a useful consideration when building into your goals. Consider how your application may address equity by focusing on one or more of these aspects. Some examples include: Integrating community stakeholders directly to the decision-making processes, planning, and implementation of your web application. (Procedural Equity) Developing an asset map of local health and social services to maximize networking and connection in your city. (Distributive Equity) Curating a story map that invites users to “walk” through a neighborhood over time as it becomes segregated from highway construction. (Contextual Equity) Activity Take a look at these three real-world projects. In your own words, sketch out their goals. Do they align with any of the SDOH application goals we’ve mapped above? What content of equity (procedural, distributive, or contextual) do they address? Data and Stats | Tulsa Health Department United States of Health Dashboard | McKinsey &amp; Company Heart Disease Death Rates Aged 35 and older, Total Population | cdc.gov Next, update your own goal statement based on ideas in this section. What are your SDOH and Equity goals? Tip This is just the beginning of a process. To keep progressing, it’s essential to always look for inspiration and stakeholders. Take some time to explore various web maps, dashboards, atlases, magazines, and academic articles. Then, list the ones you find appealing in your journal. Even if they are spatial visualizations that have nothing to do with health, try to imagine how you can use their design to study SDOH. 2.3 Defining Stakeholders Once you’ve got your project’s goals on the horizon, it’s time to look at who’s journeying with you. Collaboration and stakeholder identification are vital components of any project that aims to achieve equity. Whether it’s a non-governmental organization, a research group within a university, or a government agency, stakeholders bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the table. Similarly, communities, activists, and advocates can also play a significant role in your project’s success. Early identification of stakeholders is key to building trust and solidarity, which is a time-consuming but necessary process. In Module 3, we will delve deeper into employing User-Centered Design to engage stakeholders effectively. The aim will be to ensure that every step of the project, from conception to implementation, is done in collaboration with those who have a vested interest in the outcomes, guaranteeing that the resulting initiatives are equitable, impactful, and sustainable. For now, let’s assess your team. Assess Your Team Take an inventory of who makes up your team, and define each person’s role. If you are embedded within a larger organization or corporation, there may be expansive stakeholders involved, with multiple stages of review, implementation, and iteration. If you’re in a smaller group or you’re on your own, you may be taking on several roles at the same time. Your core team may include community members directly, or may have a different leadership structure. Here are some critical roles to consider: Responsibilities Description Set Strategy, Priorities, &amp; Standards Core Team, Leadership Allocate Resources (Time and $) Leadership Manage Processes Core Team, Project Manager Design, Research Use Cases Core Team, Designer Develop, Deploy, &amp; Monitor Project Core Team, Engineer Use the application in way that was expected Expected Users Use the application in way that was uexpected Unexpected Users There are two additional stakeholders every application developer should consider – the Champion, and the Curmudgeon, which are actual roles that have been used in Health Informatics. Considering them will be essential for your success: The Champion - They love your idea, sing its praises, and are ready to share your work with everyone they know. They may not get the “tech stuff” completely, and won’t have time to learn it if they wanted to, but are your biggest cheerleader. They may help you get funding. The Curmudgeon - They prefer to do things the way they have always been doing it. It’s generally something they do themselves, and probably manually. They are not interested in your work, and may challenge it with a sigh, eye-roll, or outright lament. May prefer technology the way it “used” to be. We caution that you not shift your work too much in either direction to please/antagonize either of these stakeholders, but rather understand their role in the process at this stage. Activity Review these two projects and identify their stakeholders. Explain what is their role in each project. Urban Youths Go 3000 Miles: Engaging and Supporting Young Residents to Conduct Neighborhood Asset Mapping | AJPH Food assets for whom? Community perspectives on food asset mapping in Canada Motivations If you find yourself to be a “curmudgeon” at the idea of working with others to support your journey, we also encourage you to take a moment to consider all the benefits of engaging more stakeholders. Here’s how a wider stakeholder alliance can shape your journey: Understanding Diverse Perspectives: Stakeholders come from various backgrounds and sectors, each bringing unique insights that can challenge and enrich your project’s approach to health. A government official might understand policy implications, while a local activist might provide a grassroots perspective on community health challenges. Data Gathering and Validation: Collaborators are crucial in both collecting and validating SDOH data. They ensure that the information reflects real-world conditions and is relevant to the communities affected. Researchers can provide rigorous methodologies, while community members can offer qualitative insights that ground the data in lived experiences. Expanding the Network: Engaging with stakeholders allows for the expansion of your network. Each stakeholder may introduce you to other relevant parties, broadening the reach and potential impact of your project. This can lead to discovering untapped resources or finding new avenues for support and advocacy. Exploring New Contexts: Stakeholders can act as guides through unfamiliar territories, both metaphorically in the project domain and literally in the community spaces. They help navigate the cultural, social, and political landscapes that shape health outcomes. Innovative Co-Design: Utilizing User-Centered Design principles, stakeholders become co-creators in developing spatial visualizations that represent SDOH. Their input ensures that the end products are not only technically sound but also culturally sensitive and user-friendly. Forging Partnerships: Collaboration can lead to long-term partnerships that extend beyond the life of a single project. These relationships can build a foundation for future initiatives, creating a sustainable impact on public health. Revising Project Goals: Stakeholders often provide new insights that can lead to a reframing of project goals. What begins as a narrow focus on a particular health issue might evolve into a more holistic approach that considers a wider range of social factors. Ensuring Equity: By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, the project is more likely to address equity in a meaningful way. Equity is not just about equal access, it’s also about designing interventions that acknowledge and address power imbalances and historical contexts that contribute to health disparities. Finding a Community of Practice Even if you think you’re getting into this solo or with a smaller team, you may be surprised at the number of people available to connect with you as invaluable colleagues, future friends, and mentors in your network. You’ve found this project – that already means you’re a part of a wider community of practice. Join our LinkedIn and GitHub pages to introduce yourself and expand your network. Additionally, consider sharing your ideas with people in your community, whether that be your neighborhood, school, or work. Tip Not sure where to start looking for mentors? We love this Mentor Map exercise by the National Center for Faculty Development &amp; Diversity – not just for academic folks, but anyone who has a beating heart and is working on a project. Try out the exercise yourself to identify persons in your network who you may be reach out to connect for feedback, accountability, intellectual discussions, and emotional support as you work through the project. 2.4 Project Assessment You now know what you want to do, and who you want to do it with. You’ve gathered your team and had a few good discussions. If you’re on your own, you’ve made a list of mentors and additional resources to connect with so you can ensure feedback throughout the process. Let’s finish scoping this project. Assess Your Strengths Each project will require domain expertise and technical capacity. Domain expertise means they are subject matter experts (SME). For example, someone who has been a 6th grade English teacher for 5 years, can be considered a SME of teaching 6th grade English. Technical capacity will refer to those people who know how to code from the back end (what only the core team sees) to the front end (what your users see). Which is your strength, and which will you need to skill up to further support for project implementation? For example: If your project is about building an asset map to support populations experiencing food insecurity, you may be a food bank volunteer who has worked directly with populations impacted, live in the community, and also would be using the application with collaboration from the regional food pantry network. In this case, you have extensive domain expertise and knowledge that will be more enriched than most web app developers, assuming you are not a developer for your day job. For this project, you will be the SME and need to find someone who has the technical capacity needed for the project or your goal will be to scale up your technical capacity within the constraints of your setting. On the other hand, perhaps you are a graduate student who has been coding statistical models for your work, and are interested in adding more social impact to your work. You’re used to learning new programming languages for new projects, and have a high technical capacity, but are not embedded within the community you want to build an asset map for. For this project, you would be the technical expert and need to find a SME or your goal will be to scale up your understanding of equity based frameworks, learning more about community experiences, as well as researching the topic further to build your domain expertise. After assessing your strengths, go back to your list of stakeholders and update as needed. Tip As you expand your stakeholder team, your project may update according to shared goals and visions of team members. As a result, your team will work through the assessment process more than once. This iterative process is expected. Activity Write down your purpose and objectives by clearly stating why you want to solve this problem and what you hope to achieve. Who is your target audience? Next, make a list of your potential stakeholders. How would you contact your stakeholders and why would they be interested in collaborating with you? Would you be part of an ongoing project or propose a new one? The format for this exercise is flexible and exploratory. You can opt to create lists of objectives, draw diagrams, write a structured plan, or engage in a free-writing exercise. The primary aim of this task is to develop a foundation to begin exploring spatial data for your project. It’s important to note that your final prototype might diverge significantly from what you record in this entry, and that’s perfectly acceptable. Remember, the process of using SDOH spatial data for visualizations is a dynamic process. Assess Project Needs Project Needs will include data, computer services, time, and attitude. To assess this, you will need to survey your motivation and pain points, as well as technical, financial, people, and time resources. Data: What data do you have, and what will you need to find? How comfortable are you working with data, and what is the state of data where you are now? Do you curate community resources on post-it notes, PDFs, spreadsheets, or databases? Consider taking a data maturity assessment to better understand your data strategy along dimensions of purpose, practice, and people. Take your data skills a notch or two to the next level, progressing with patience, rather than jumping into a complex warehousing project that could be overkill. Computing Resources: Do you have expansive computing resources and software available to you (e.g. large university of industry environment), or are you seeking free and/or low cost computing solutions? If you’re developing a project for a team member at a different institution, can they access the technical resources needed, or would they need to purchase a costly subscription? Knowing what resources are available to you is essential for selecting the best approach for app development. Community: Are you working within an isolated environment, or do you have multiple colleagues who are ready to help? Perhaps you’re surrounded by people, but everyone is already overstretched with their work. At the same time, who will take over the project when you’ve moved on — are there interns, analysts, or volunteers interested in learning from your findings? Identify your needs. Attitude: This facet is also crucial, and can help you decide which adventure to choose in later modules. If troubleshooting coding bugs like tasty puzzles sounds fun, take the coding route, even if you’ve never seen yourself as a coder. If you just want to get through the application building process as fast as possible to move on to a different project, go for a software-based option instead. You may find yourself to be a prototyper, enjoying the process of building a project; or an optimizer, instead wanting to refine pieces until they are perfect. The best teams have both! Consider sustainability at this stage. What will your project look like in five years? Is there an app for that? In the ever-evolving landscape of data visualization and technology, it’s essential to explore existing tools and applications before embarking on a new project. This not only saves time and resources but also allows you to benefit from the wealth of solutions that may already address your needs. Here are some ideas to help you determine if there’s an app or web visualization that aligns with your SDOH data visualization project: Research Existing Solutions Start by conducting thorough research on existing data visualization tools and applications. Look for platforms that specialize in healthcare, public health, or social determinants of health. Consider both general-purpose visualization tools and those specifically designed for SDOH. Collaborate and Network Connect with professionals in the field of public health and data visualization. Attend conferences, webinars, or join online forums where experts discuss SDOH projects. Networking can provide valuable insights into tools that have been successfully used in similar projects. Evaluate Open Source Solutions Consider open-source visualization tools and frameworks. Open-source projects often have active communities and can be tailored to specific needs. GitHub and other repositories are great places to explore such solutions. Consult with Peers and Stakeholders Reach out to colleagues, peers, and stakeholders involved in similar projects. They might have insights into tools that have proven effective in their work. Collaboration can lead to shared resources and knowledge. Check for Integration Capabilities If your project involves integration with existing systems or databases, ensure that the identified tools have the necessary integration capabilities. Compatibility with data sources is crucial for a seamless visualization experience. Consider Customization and Scalability Assess whether the existing tools can be customized to meet the specific requirements of your SDOH data visualization project. Additionally, evaluate their scalability to accommodate potential future expansions or changes in data sources. Evaluate Cost and Licensing Analyze the cost implications and licensing requirements of using existing tools. Some applications may be free, while others might have subscription fees or licensing agreements. Factor in your budget constraints when making a decision. By thoroughly exploring existing solutions, you can make informed decisions about whether to build from scratch or leverage the capabilities of existing apps and web visualizations for your SDOH project. Remember, a well-researched approach can lead to more efficient and impactful data visualization outcomes. 2.5 Finalize Approach The field of project management is vast, interdisciplinary, and always growing. Here are some highlights that can go a long way in scoping your project effectively and finalizing goals In these steps, you’ll move from ideas to a concrete plan. Define SMART Goals You’ve already sketched out a few goals for your project, including an overview and SDOH-specific plans. Now let’s get specific. Establish SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals or similar criteria for the project to ensure clarity and effectiveness: Specific: Clearly define the objectives and outcomes of the project. Measurable: Set quantifiable metrics to assess progress and success. Achievable: Ensure that goals are realistic and feasible within the project scope. Relevant: Align project goals with the overall purpose and objectives. Time-Bound: Define specific timelines for the completion of key milestones and the entire project. Check out resources at the end of this module for more examples of SMART goals &amp; resources. Define Requirements System Requirements Based on the inventory of your project assessment above, you’re ready to generate a list of system requirements. Identify major system capabilities (e.g. must use free or opensource technologies; must integrate new data contributed with approval), system assumptions or constraints (e.g. you will have access to colleagues for support; you have a limited budget and time to accomplish goals), user characteristics, and any other requirements. Review your project needs, your own strengths, and stakeholder needs defined earlier in this module. You may find multiple templates online for ideas. User Requirements Identify the goals for your intended audience. Be specific about the types of interaction you have in mind. Following are a number of potential options, with increasing complexity: Implement a user-friendly interface with features like drop-down selection, click for pop-up windows, and storytelling to enhance access to information. Ensure that users can easily explore relevant data points and insights related to social determinants of health (SDOH) within their specified areas. Incorporate interactive elements such as sliders and number entry fields to allow users to input specific parameters, enabling a more personalized and focused exploration of the data. Design the application to respond dynamically to user inputs, providing real-time visualizations and insights based on the selected criteria. Word of the Day: Affordances These user behaviors, like anticipated clicks or zooming to view, are called affordances in the design space. Affordances are clues that an object can be used to perform some action. If you see what looks like a button on the internet, you may want to click it. If you see a slider, you may want to slide it. Designing products well take affordances into account. In this stage of planning, you’re engineering things so that your audience will know what to do intuitively, based on these visual cues. A deeper dive into the topic can be found at Smashing Magazine. Break Down Details Generate a Timeline Develop a detailed timeline outlining the various stages of the project, from data preparation and analysis to application development and deployment. Clearly define milestones and deadlines to track progress effectively. Task Breakdown Break down the project into manageable tasks and subtasks, assigning responsibilities to team members based on their expertise. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and critical paths to ensure a smooth workflow. Process Documentation Establish a systematic approach to document the entire process, including data preparation steps, analysis methodologies, and application development strategies. Maintain a comprehensive record of decisions made, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented throughout the project. Communication Plan Develop a communication plan that outlines how team members and stakeholders will stay informed about project progress. Define regular check-ins, status updates, and channels for effective communication within the team. Enable Agile Processes While there are many project management styles out there, we recommend approaches that allow for regular updates and revisions. The traditional “waterfall” method of developing a project on your own and delivering it one go is not realistic for complex spatial data visualization work about SDOH &amp; Place, as you’ll miss crucial engagements and opportunities for improvement along the way. We recommend embracing “agile” methodologies to foster flexibility and adaptability in project execution, especially the processes of iterative development and user-centered design. Iterative Development Implement an iterative development approach, allowing for continuous refinement and improvement based on feedback and evolving requirements. Conduct regular sprint cycles to review and adjust project goals, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations. User-Centered Design Prioritize user feedback and engagement throughout the development process, incorporating user-centered design principles. Conduct usability testing to gather insights into user preferences and refine the application interface accordingly. By establishing clear deliverables and defining an agile and well-documented process, the project can proceed systematically and effectively, addressing the identified objectives and stakeholder needs. Activity Establish your final Project Requirements, based on the assessment completed in this module. They should include: Your project overview Your project goals &amp; objectives System Requirements User Requirements Timeline Indicate which project management approach you’ll be adopting. Include a few sentences to describe your process and communications plan. This will be a work in progress, so feel free to update as you go!

In this module, you’re going to learn the ropes of Human-Centered Design (HCD)—it’s all about making sure our designs click with the very people they’re meant for. We’re talking about a real connection. The primary objective of a successful data visualization method should be to meet the needs of the individuals who will be using it. This entails understanding their objectives in using web applications, their situations, and their familiarity levels. It’s essential to determine the design approaches that would most effectively cater to these requirements. Not planning appropriately can lead to revising the design which would eventually slow you down from releasing the application you have in mind. Therefore, a crucial first step of any data visualization planning process is to identify the users and understand what they want out of the visualization. 3.1 Brief Discussion of Design Methods Let’s dive into the world of design methodologies, where each approach brings something special to the table. Our star player here is Human-Centered Design (HCD), a method that puts people at the heart of the design process. HCD is all about getting into the users’ shoes, understanding what they need and want, and then crafting solutions that hit the mark. But that’s not the whole story. We’re also going to peek into some other relevant and overlapping design methods, each with its flavor. Design Methods Type Description Human-Centered Design (User-Focused Design Approach) An approach to problem-solving that starts with people and ends with innovative solutions tailored to suit their needs. It involves understanding the perspective of the users for whom you’re designing, generating a range of ideas, and iteratively testing and refining solutions Participatory Design (Collaborative Design Approach) A process that involves all stakeholders, especially users, in the design process. The aim is to ensure that the designed product meets the needs and expectations of the users. It often involves workshops, user interviews, and collaborative sessions where users actively contribute ideas and feedback. Design Thinking (Problem-Solving Framework) A non-linear, iterative process used to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. It comprises five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. This approach encourages questioning, experimentation, observation, and innovation. Universal Design (Accessibility-Focused Design Approach) Involves creating products and environments that are accessible and usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. It emphasizes simplicity, intuitiveness, and accommodating a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. Experience Design ([XD] User Experience Focused Design Approach) Focused on the quality of the user experience and culturally relevant solutions. It goes beyond the product itself to include all aspects of the user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. 3.2 Human-Centered Design Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a well-researched framework that provides a set of guidelines and processes to ensure that designs cater to the desires, abilities, and contexts of their potential end users. HCD guides developers to empathize with users, understand their needs, wants, and experiences, and create designs that engage users and adapt to the context of their real lives. Employing HCD can improve accessibility, reduce the risk of negative outcomes, and enhance user well-being. Applications of HCD principles have generated a design process that tends to share the following four steps: 1) identifying user needs, 2) designing to those needs, 3) evaluating the design and iterating until users are satisfied. Throughout these steps, the developer will constantly “diverge” their ideas to think wide and open while “converge” their scope and prototype with focus. Step 1: Identifying User Needs The first step of the HCD process is to understand what a user hopes to accomplish and the conditions that will allow them to do so. To determine user needs, inclusive workshops are an effective way of bringing users into the design process and empowering them to share their goals for the tool as well as their particular concerns and contexts that might shape their use of the application. The success of these workshops depends on how well the participants represent a potentially diverse end-user group: to best understand the true breadth of needs to be considered, users of all different backgrounds, experience levels, and goals must be given equal opportunity to provide insight. Virtual meetings (over Zoom, for example) are an effective way to hold these workshops. Virtual meetings allow for a broader spectrum of users to participate. In these meetings, it is recommended to include multimodal communication, such as a mix of presentations, live discussions, polling, and a chat function. This ensures that participants with varying levels and preferences of engagement get an opportunity to speak their minds. It is also important to establish common terminology with workshop participants as they may not be familiar with application design or data discovery. Therefore, efforts should be made to explain certain functionalities with examples to allow participants to articulate what sorts of features they may benefit from. Free online platforms are available to enable a virtual, collaborative brainstorming session to determine user needs. FigJam and Miro, for example, are free online collaboration tools that allow users to brainstorm and organize ideas, allowing for real-time interactive sessions between team members. Alternatively, if you’re lucky that all your users are available for an in-person workshop, then using a whiteboard, sticky notes, and other stationery is just fine as well. Activity One of the most effective ways to get started with identifying user needs is to create details around each user persona. This way, you can not only test the assumptions that you make about your personas but also see how far you can ideate on their potential needs. The primary object is to understand the personas by gaining a deep understanding of their needs, preferences, behaviors, and goals. This understanding is crucial for developing the application in the direction that resonates with their needs. During the exercise, personas are looked at from a more humanized lens that helps build empathy as it is easier to relate to a fictional character representing a real user than to an abstract persona. We recommend using the User Persona FigJam template to collaborate and build a meaningful set of user personas. Step 2: Designing to User Needs The next step of the HCD process is to determine a web application design that will meet user needs. An application’s user interface is a key element of design for developers to consider. To involve users in this process, card sorting is one effective method of participatory design, in which users are given note cards representing application functions and are asked to arrange them in ways they would find most easily to navigate on a web page. Creating a full list of functions that will help users meet their goals, such as the ability to query a dataset using keywords, or zoom in on particular locations in a map, is a helpful first step of this process. During the card sorting activity, don’t hesitate to create, remove, or edit cards that may be suggested by the users. This technique often serves as a guidance for taking the next step, but you should feel free to adapt and improvise as needed. Developers should also consider how data will be organized into meaningful categories. For health equity applications, for example, it is often useful to divide data by demographics. The design of graphic icons, buttons, window layouts, symbols, text fonts, and color schemes is also crucial to this step. Researchers have identified certain principles of design that seem to be broadly visually appealing and successful. These include: Navigation tools should be highly visible, intuitive, &amp; consistently placed Writing should be presented in readable blocks Text should be easy to read and appropriate size, color, and font Elements should be organized in an understandable structure denoted by meaningful headings Images should be relevant, clear, and properly sized Overall layout should be minimalist, uncluttered, and balance color with an effective use of white space. There exists a variety of open-source tools freely available on the internet to collaboratively design user interface prototypes. Several options include: FigJam: A collaborative design tool often used for user interface design. FigJam is entirely browser-based and includes many helpful design tools, adaptable templates, and allows for real-time collaboration. Wondershare Mockitt: Similar to Figma, Mockitt includes a wide variety of design tools, but may be an easier platform to use for design beginners. Quant-UX: Quant-UX includes design tools similar to the above platforms, but includes features that allow for usability testing and analysis. Activity Choose one of the above platforms and create a free account. Walk through their getting-started steps to learn how to use the platform. If you find the platform confusing or limiting, try out another and compare. Also, visit design mockup websites such as Dribbble and Behance to search for creative inspiration on user interface design. Step 3: Evaluation and Iteration The next step of the HCD process is to evaluate how usable, accessible, and satisfying the initial web application design is for users. To do so, it is crucial to solicit user feedback through user testing and evaluation. An effective method of evaluation is to have users test out a prototype of the design and give feedback on their experience, a process that can be facilitated through a variety of means, including focus groups and online surveys. More about this in Module 6. The questions users are asked should allow developers to evaluate the extent to which the application meets established user needs and the extent to which the application is usable. Components of usability include: Useful: It must be original and meet a specific need. Usable: The site should be straightforward to navigate. Desirable: The use of images, branding, and other design elements should create an emotional connection. Findable: Content should be easy to find, both within the site and from external sources. Accessible: The content must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. Credible: The information provided should be trustworthy and believable to the user. There are a variety of ways to test for usability. These evaluations can be conducted virtually through surveys, or conducted live by bringing a group of users together for in-person interviews or having them think aloud as they navigate through the web application. Across evaluations, it is important to administer a set of background questions to understand users’ demographics, their roles or occupations, and their overall goals to understand how individuals across different contexts differ in how usable they find the web application. Surveys are generally the least resource-intensive method of evaluation. When designing a usability survey, it is crucial to ask questions that will shed light on how usable, enjoyable, and effective individuals find the tool. These surveys can include a mix of multiple-choice, ratings, and open-response questions. Examples include: What are your main objectives when using this tool? Were you able to meet those goals? What features do you use most? How easily navigable did you find the interface? Was it visually appealing? What would you like to see change (or stay the same) about the tool? There exist many online platforms to create surveys. Google Forms is a free, easy-to-use tool that allows for unlimited questions and offers a full range of question types. Google Forms will not analyze the data collected. Qualtrics is a more powerful tool for survey design and can generate a quantitative analysis of the data. Qualtrics includes a free option, however, there is a steeper learning curve to creating these surveys than a tool like Google Forms. Using printed sheets with survey questions can also work if the setup is in-person. Based on the survey respondents and their level of comfort, their responses may need to be recorded anonymously. Following evaluation, developers should revise the application accordingly, and re-evaluate and redesign until user needs are sufficiently satisfied. Constantly keeping in touch with stakeholders and users make it easier to design for them. Lastly, try accommodating as much feedback but don’t let it come in the way of you from moving forward to the next steps. Activity User Personas One of the most effective ways to get started with identifying user needs is to create details around each user persona. This way, you can not only test the assumptions that you make about your personas but also see how far you can ideate on their potential needs. The primary object is to understand the personas by gaining a deep understanding of their needs, preferences, behaviors, and goals. This understanding is crucial for developing the application in the direction that resonates with their needs. During the exercise, personas are looked at from a more humanized lens that helps build empathy as it is easier to relate to a fictional character representing a real user than to an abstract persona. We recommend using the User Persona FigJam template to collaborate and build a meaningful set of user personas. Step 1: Accessing FigJam and load the User Persona FigJam template Go to the Figma website (https://www.figma.com/) and sign in or create a new account. - If you don’t have an account, click on “Sign Up” to create a new account. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process. You can choose a free account, but if you have the chance, pick the academic account since it provides more perks. Once you sign up, Figma will lead you to your personal workspace. Under Teams (left part of the screen), select “Create new team.” Name your new team as you like, we will name it “Place Project.” You can skip adding your collaborators and choose the starter option. Figure 3.1.2 Once you have your new team, Click on this link to access the User Persona FigJam template webpage and click on the “open in Figjam” button. This action will lead you to your new user persona template. Step 2: Edit the User Persona Template Once the template is open, you’ll see a canvas with predefined sections for different aspects of a user persona (e.g., demographics, goals, frustrations). Take a few minutes to explore this template. You can zoom into specific sections. Figure 3.2.1 You will see the name of the file on the top of the canvas. The default name is “User persona (community)” Click on the arrow and choose “rename.” You may name your new file “Place Project - User Personas,” but you can pick your own name. Click on the arrow once again and pick “move to project” and move your file under the team you created on Step 1.2 of this guide. Figure 3.2.2 Now that your file is in the correct project, click on each section on the canvas to edit the text and add details relevant to your potential user personas. You may change the image of your personas, change their personality traits by moving the sliders, and write on the sticky notes their interests, motivations, goals, pain points and frustrations etc. Figure 3.2.3 You can also use the drawing tools, sticky notes, and connectors (below of the screen) to enhance the visual representation of your user personas. You can also copy and paste different elements of this template. For example, right click on the “Basic Information Section,” paste it on the canvas and move this section just below your first persona. Do the same with the “More about’’ section. Now, you can have multiple personas with different skills, motivations, and personalities. Figure 3.2.5 FigJam automatically saves your work, but it’s a good practice to save manually the version history as well. Perhaps you may want to come back to a previous version of your template. Click on the main menu icon in the top-left corner and choose “file” then select “Save to version history” and follow the instructions. Step 3: Collaborate with Others FigJam is designed for collaboration. Click on the “Share” button in the top-right corner to invite some of your colleagues of the Place Project Fellowship to provide you feedback in real-time. You can use their emails or provide them with a link to your canvas. You may use sticky notes to communicate and work together in order to refine your user personas. However, another way to do it is by clicking on the “Add comment” (e.g., speech globe) icon at the top of the canvas, selecting where you want to add the comment on the canvas and writing it. Figure 3.3.2 Step 4: Save and Export If you need to share the user personas outside of FigJam, you can export the file by clicking on the “Main Menu” icon, selecting “File” and “Export as” to choose your desired format (PDF, JPG. PNG etc). Step 5: Iterate and Refine User personas are dynamic, and your project may evolve. Use FigJam to iterate and refine your user personas as needed. Collaborate with your team at the Place Project to gather feedback and make improvements to ensure the personas accurately reflect your target audience. On your own try to create at least three potential User Personas for your project and share it with your Place Project colleagues. Also do not forget to provide some feedback to them. Congratulations! You’ve successfully used a FigJam template to create user personas for your project. Feel free to explore other FigJam features to enhance your collaborative design process.
