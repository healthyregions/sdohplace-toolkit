# Coding for app development

## Getting Started with Github and Github Pages

In these exercises we'll begin working with a code sharing platform called [Github](https://github.com) that is used by software developers, researchers, and hobbyists all around the world. With a free account on Github, you are able to upload code bases and datasets into public repositories, allowing other people to see your work, contribute to it, or build from it.

One especially useful tool that the platform provides is called Github Pages, a mechanism that allows you to turn any single repository into a publicly accessible website for free. Github Pages is a perfect way to create a personal website, blog, or portfolio site, but we can also use it to host and serve simple web maps and visualizations. The following tips will help you get started with Github.

### What is a Repository?

A repository is any collection of code or data that is stored together as a unit. For example, the entire code base for [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle), or [covid-19-data] downloads from the NY Times.

### Understanding Github's URL Structure - Naming is important!

Github is organized with a simple hierarchy: Account > Repository Name, where accounts can be either individual users, or organizational accounts. For example, our HeRoP lab organization is [healthyregions](https://github.com/healthyregions) which means that our repository "sdohplace-toolkit" (this toolkit!) is located at [https://github.com/healthyregions/sdohplace-toolkit](https://github.com/healthyregions/sdohplace-toolkit).

### Creating an Account

When you choose a username, pick something simple that can be shared easily, because, as described above, your username will be in public urls all the time. Additionally, when you publish a repository with Github Pages, that user name will become part of the URL for your page.

## Leaflet Map with CSV and GeoJSON data

Leaflet is a very popular open source mapping library used to create interactive web maps. Leaflet is written in JavaScript, a programming language that runs in all web browsers, so creating a map with Leaflet will involve at least a bit of looking at and modifying code--HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript which are the foundational components of any webpage.

**Tip**

Our example builds from [Leaflet Maps with CSV Data](https://handsondataviz.org/leaflet-maps-with-csv.html) from [HandsOnDataViz](https://handsondataviz.org/), a fantastic collection of guides and recipes for data visualization by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou that focus on using open source and accessible technologies. We strongly encourage you to explore all of their other content as well!
:::

Generally speaking, libraries like Leaflet create web maps by defining an area of a web page, like a canvas, and then loading various geospatial data into that area, allowing users to pan, zoom, inspect, and interact with the content. In this example, we will create and publish a very simple web map using prepared CSV and GeoJSON datasets. At the end of the exercise, you should be able to swap these datasets out with your own, and have a basic understanding of how to modify Leaflet code.

We will do all of our file storage and editing directly in [Github](https://github.com), which will also allow us to immediately make our map publicly visible.

## Thematic Map with HTML & CSS




## Dashboards with R Shiny

### Getting Started {-}

Once you have a solid sense of R (see previous modules and recommended tutorials), you may be ready to make your first app! To develop an application quickly, we use the `shiny` package. Shiny is a web application framework for R that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. This particular application allows users to explore various demographic metrics through interactive maps and charts.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("shiny")
```

We recommend going through the [beginner lessons on Shiny applications](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html) at Posit before diving into your app development directly. Get familiar with the basics, practice, and explore different example apps for ideas. 

![](images/6-shinyintro.png){width=95%}

As you go through these, resist the urge to try to incorporate everything into your own app. Follow the design-thinking process, user input, and diagrams you built in previous modules!

A Shiny app can be contained in a single script, `app.R`, which will have the following three components:

- a user interface object

- a server function

- a call to the `shinyApp` function

![RShiny Application Structure. Source: [Coding Club UC3M](https://codingclubuc3m.rbind.io/post/2018-06-19/)](images/06-overview-shinyApp.png){width=50%}

### User Interface

You can define the layout of your application using the user inferface, defining what goes where, how it looks, and what events are triggered. Upon loading the site, a default plot may be triggered to be oupit. A user may also select specific items within the user interface, like a variable from a drop-down panel, or sliding a slider. 

Using the [example](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/) from Shiny's official tutorial, copy and paste the following into a new file you'll save as `app.R` in a folder on your computer. 

To run within RStudio, click the "Knit" icon at the top of your code.

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide', eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bslib)

# Define UI ----
ui <- page_sidebar(
)

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Following the same example, add a title to your application, a sidebar, and a main section. In this example, we'll make a an on SDOH indicators in NYC.

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide', eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bslib)

# Define UI ----
ui <- 
  page_sidebar(
    title = "NYC SDOH App",
    sidebar = sidebar("sidebar"),
    "main contents"
  )

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Next, let's add a drop down variable selection for a variable of interest we'd like to explore in the app. For example, we may want to examine data by self-identified race and ethnicity, as reported by neighborhood via the Census. We'll add a drop-down widget, and "helper text" to explain what the user should do.

Try to do this on your own first. Then, check the code below! 

<details markdown='1'><summary>Show Code</summary>
```{r class.source = 'fold-hide', eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(bslib)

# Define UI ----
ui <- 
  page_sidebar(
    title = "NYC SDOH App",
    sidebar = sidebar(
      
      helpText("Select different variables from the dropdown menus to explore the data."),
      
      selectInput("color", "Self-Identified Race & Ethnicity:",
                  choices = c("Percent Black" = "pctblack",
                              "Percent Hispanic" = "pcthisp",
                              "Percent White" = "pctwhite"),
                  selected = "pctblack"),
    ),
  )

# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output) {
}

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
</br></br></details>

Ensure you're running each time that you add, edit, or change anything. This helps with the troubleshooting process! By now, your application will be looking like this:

![](images/06-shiny1.png){width=95%}

Continue to explore the different layouts, widgets, themes, and options available to you in the Shiny documentation.

### Server

When we're running the application, we're actually using our computer as the server. Let's connect our dropdown to data we'll load in -- NYC data -- and use the user selection to generate a map. 

We recommend getting the script to work in an R script on its own before plugging in, to confirm that it will work the way you need it to. De-bugging can be tricky in more complex applications, so anything you can do to support your process will be beneficial.

We'll jump a few steps ahead, to show what the full set up can look like for adding a map that is linked to user input:

<details markdown='1'><summary>Show Full App Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

# Load data ----
nyc_data <- st_read("NYC_nbrhd_data.geojson", quiet = TRUE)
nyc_data <- st_make_valid(nyc_data)
map_data <- st_transform(nyc_data, crs = 4326)

# Define UI ----
ui <- 
  page_sidebar(
    title = "NYC SDOH App",
    sidebar = sidebar(
      
      helpText("Select different variables from the dropdown menus to explore the data."),
      
      selectInput("color", "Self-Identified Race & Ethnicity:",
                  choices = c("Percent Black" = "pctblack",
                              "Percent Hispanic" = "pcthisp",
                              "Percent White" = "pctwhite"),
                  selected = "pctblack")),
      
      mainPanel(
        ## Add a map
        (leafletOutput("map", width = "100%")
        )))
  
# Define server logic ----
server <- function(input, output, session) {
    
    # Map output for Racial Demographics
    output$map <- renderLeaflet({

      valid_data <- map_data[!is.na(map_data[[input$color]]), ]
      
      pal <- colorQuantile("PuBuGn", valid_data[[input$color]], n = 5)
      
      leaflet(valid_data) %>%
        addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
        addPolygons(
          fillColor = ~pal(valid_data[[input$color]]),
          fillOpacity = 0.7, weight = 1, color = "white",
          popup = ~paste(NTAName, "<br>",
                         paste(input$color, ":", round(valid_data[[input$color]], 2), "%"))
        ) %>%
        setView(lng = -73.935242, lat = 40.730610, zoom = 10)
    })
  }

# Run the app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
</br></br></details>

Which renders the following:

![](images/5-ShinyAppV1.png){width=95%}

Inspect how the map output call was added to the UI. In the server function, the map data is slightly cleaned (from debugging in a script on its own), and a color palette is indicated using a ColorBrewer selection. Then, we use leaflet to visualize the variable selected by the user. We have found that leaflet is more responsive than tmap when using Shiny apps, though be sure to explore new options on your own!

### Expand Your Prototype

It's easier to get a basic prototype up and running. Now the fun and frustrating part begins! Start editing, updating, refining, and getting closer to your final goal. Multiple updates are included in these refinements of our expanded prototype across UI and Server settings, including:

- Addition of new tabs with addtional variables, visualizations, and content about the project.

- Integration of a new Shiny library, 'shinythemes'. After exploring how to add and update a new theme, the library was installed, and a call made in the final part of the application. (Hint: look for the 'yeti' theme in the final code.) Get more ideas at [Shiny Themes](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/).

- Improvements on performance via lots of 'tinkering' and testing. A slow scatterplot was fixed by removing the spatial components of the dataset, using the `st_drop_geometry()` call in the `sf` framework. A list of neighborhood names was made alphabetical. And so much more... 

Look for some of the "easter eggs" in code snippets below, and see how you can improve and refine further! The app could get even more fine-tuned, "reactive" (and less reptitive in coding output), and styled further.

#### Updated User Interface {-}

In our extension, we want the final UI organize into three main tabs, allowing users to interactively explore different facets of the NYC neighborhood data. For this example, we'll try using tabs instead of a sidebar. Try blending both styles, and keeping the bootstrap library used in our initial example as a challenge.

##### Tab 1: Map & Racial Demographics {-}

In the first tab, we'll features a map and a demographic chart, with controls for selecting demographic variables and neighborhoods. Here are the explanation for some functions that we used below:

- `selectInput` for variable of interest: Allows users to select which `variable` statistic to visualize on the map.
- `selectInput` for neighborhood: Enables users to pick a specific neighborhood for detailed demographic breakdown in the chart.
- `leafletOutput` and `plotlyOutput`: Reserved spaces in the UI for displaying the map and the chart respectively.

##### Tab 3: Severe Maternal Morbidity & Preterm Birth Rates {-}

In Tab 3, we want to introduces more health-related variables, displaying a map and a scatter plot. The scatter plot takes time to load, so further de-bugging may be necessary. Try alternate libraries, styles, and new approaches to refine further.

##### Tab 4: About {-}

Finally, we also want to include a Tab 4 that provides contextual information about the application, explaining its purpose and the data source.

We are making a prototype, so use some "Lorem Ipsum" placeholder language that we can update in the future.

#### Define Server Logic

After define the user interface, we will move on to define the server logic. It processes user inputs from the UI and updates the outputs (maps and charts). It dynamically reacts to user interactions such as selecting a neighborhood or a demographic variable.

##### Server Logic for Tabs {-}

Now, we will create server code to handle the dynamic visualization of racial demographics within New York City neighborhoods in Tab 1. It renders an interactive map and a bar chart based on user inputs, showing the distribution of different racial groups. The map highlights neighborhoods with varying demographic densities, while the bar chart provides detailed statistics for a selected neighborhood.

The server functions for other tabs follow a similar structure but focus on different data attributes. So, let's define the server logic for other three tabs.

    pal <- colorQuantile("viridis", valid_data[[input$race]], n = 5)
    
    leaflet(valid_data) %>%
      addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
      addPolygons(
        fillColor = ~pal(valid_data[[input$race]]),

The goal in the third tab is to generate an interactive scatter plot to exist alongside the choropleth map selection. Here's a preview of what the final application page will look like:

#### Run the Application 

Combine all tabs into a single UI object. In a final step, we combine the server logic for all tabs and define the overall UI layout to launch the application. 

<details markdown='1'><summary>Show UI Summary Code </summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("NYC Neighborhood Demographics"),
  tabsetPanel(
    tab1_ui,
    tab2_ui,
    tab3_ui,
    tab4_ui
  )
)
```
</br></br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>Show Server Summary Code </summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Combine server logic for all tabs
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  tab1_server(input, output, session)
  tab2_server(input, output, session)
  tab3_server(input, output, session)
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
</br></br></details>

The final application will render as the following. Inspect the full code [here](), and continue to refine to improve your prototype.

This Shiny application offers an interactive exploration of demographic data across New York City neighborhoods. Users can interactively analyze racial and socioeconomic information through dynamically updated maps and charts. The application highlights how R and Shiny can be used to build engaging and informative data visualizations.
