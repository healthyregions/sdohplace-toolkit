## Preface {-}


The [SDOH & Place Project Community Toolkit](https://sdohplace.org/) aims to increase the capacity for community and civic organizations in health to:

 - Access and work with social determinants of health (SDOH) data (i.e., place/spatial data)
 - Use place data for social good and to further health equity
 - Develop engaging and compelling apps to inspire, activate, and retain users
 - Work within an open ecosystem infrastructure

The SDOH & Place Project Community Toolkit connects equity principles with analysis and design of spatial visualizations for SDOH spatial data. This toolkit draws inspiration from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission’s findings, which assessed [how communities’s health and life expectancy are affected by the places where they live](https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/interactives/whereyouliveaffectshowlongyoulive.html). To address this issue, RWJF has previously created resources to [promote health equity](https://www.rwjf.org/en/building-a-culture-of-health/focus-areas/Features/achieving-health-equity.html).

In order to identify and engage with the necessities of different social actors, the community toolkit is based on the principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD). HCD is a well-researched framework that ensures the potential users’ desires, abilities, and contexts are at the core of interactive systems and applications. HCD consists of four main steps: identifying users’ needs, designing for those needs, evaluating, and iterating. Inspired by HCD, the community toolkit is built upon an ongoing co-creation and evaluation process that leverages the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, and analysts.

# Introduction

:::objective
**Objectives**

In this module, you will:

* Expand your understanding of the social determinants of health and equity
* Learn how spatial data visualizations are used in public health   
* Define four main types of web mapping applications

By the end, you should have an idea of which type of spatial data visualization type you plan to work with for your project.
:::

Think of spatial data visualizations as your bridge to meaningful conversations in public health. Nevertheless, crafting insightful maps, dashboards, or other spatial representations can be challenging, due to both technical and methodological hurdles. The path to creating an effective spatial data visualization does not commence with software usage; rather, it initiates with stakeholder meetings, annotations, and sketches. Therefore, a objective of this toolkit is to encourage you to invest time in thinking about your potential visualization and considering the individuals who will reap its benefits. 

Annotations, sketches, and meeting summaries can be handwritten in a notebook or digitally generated on a computer. We recommend creating a journal for this toolkit to annotate and store your notes. Your toolkit journal will assist you in organizing your thoughts, creating new content, making sketches, saving code, writing notes from meetings, and reflecting on your mapping process. Indeed, the production of relevant visualizations related to SDOH is a lengthy and complex process that requires creativity, organization, and technological skills. Your journal can be an invaluable companion on your journey.

## SDOH & Place 

When we talk about the factors that shape our health, it's not just about biology or lifestyle — it's about where we live and the complex tapestry of history, society, and economy that frames our lives. The [social determinants of health (SDOH)](https://www.cdc.gov/about/sdoh/index.html) encompass a range of historical, social, cultural, political, and economic factors that significantly impact the well-being of individuals and their communities. These SDOH aren't just statistics; they're stories of communities and the places we call home, varying from one street to the next. They're about whether we have parks over parking lots, fresh food on shelves, and whether our neighborhoods are marked by support or segregation.

![Figure 1.1 - Classic representations of the SDOH. Source: K. Barronville](images/preface-SDOH1.png){width=80%} 

The social determinants of health are complex and exist at many different scales — the individual, interpersonal, community, and regional levels. In this toolkit, we focus on how the **SDOH emerge at community and regional levels**. For example, neighborhoods will have differing availability of fresh produce, community clinics, and job opportunities, impacting how residents are able to successfully eat healthy, visit health providers, and afford housing essentials. By using neighborhood or regional scales of data to approximate SDOH, we can begin to get a deeper sense of the complex environment in which people live, work, and play. When working with measures at neighborhood-levels, a spatial view is essential to enable us to work with the data, from data wrangling to visualization and analysis. A [neighborhood-view of SDOH](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2759757) is multidimensional, and can predict over 60% of premature deaths. 

Academics, activists, government agents, and policymakers have employed data visualizations to examine the connections between places and SDOH. For example, they have utilized dashboards to study the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable communities. They implemented [participatory mapping](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0123.htm) to advocate for policy-based interventions, and deployed [story maps](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/ddf1b1212ec9c9aac4bebe45196b367d/hi-update-english/index.html) to promote health initiatives. To produce these data visualizations, health researchers and advocates mobilize a wide array of conceptual frameworks and diverse technical skill sets. Moreover, data visualizations in public health do not only analyze the relationship between places and SDOH. They promote health equity: "a state in which everyone has a fair and equitable opportunity to achieve their highest level of health" (CDC's Office of Health Equity, 2022).

## Centering Equity
The concept of equity in public health data visualizations goes beyond mere stylistic enhancements to aid in comprehension or research. It extends to encompass connections to pertinent resources and diverse language options, for example, empowering communities with information, processes, and agency to transform, advocate for, and influence residents, neighborhoods, and broader political, economic, and social structures towards healthier systems.

Let's dive deeper into how we can make data visualizations not just informative, but also inclusive and impactful. You see, it's not all about graphs and numbers. By weaving in stories and multimedia—like videos and interactive media streams—we open up a world where data talks to everyone, not just to those who love statistics.

Imagine a dashboard that not only shows you the trends but also tells you the stories behind the numbers. It's designed with real people in mind, adapting to a variety of preferences—whether you’re someone who loves a good narrative or someone who digs deep into the data.

However, we've got to acknowledge that sometimes, our public health systems fall short. They miss the mark on painting the full picture of health disparities. That’s why, when we're talking about Place & SDOH, we need to put equity at the heart of our work—from the word go, right through to the final pixel of the design. It's not just a 'nice-to-have'; it's a must-do for visualizations that truly resonate with and serve all communities.

### Equity Orientation {-}

The [equity orientation in a public health data system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9508440/) involves several key components that must be outlined to address health disparities and promote equitable outcomes effectively. 

These components include:

#### Setting Parameters of Equity: {-}
- **Decision-Making Inclusion:** The process of setting parameters for equity should involve diverse stakeholders, including representatives from marginalized communities, to ensure that the perspectives and needs of all affected populations are considered.
- **Target Population:** It is crucial to identify the specific populations and communities that are the focus of efforts to improve equity. This includes recognizing vulnerable groups that historically experience disparities in health outcomes.

#### Focus on Equity: {-}
- **Differential Needs:** An equity-oriented approach acknowledges that different populations have varying needs and histories. It recognizes the importance of tailoring interventions to address these disparities rather than assuming that a one-size-fits-all approach will be sufficient.
- **Addressing Historical Considerations:** An equity-oriented system acknowledges historical injustices and systemic discrimination that have contributed to current health disparities. It seeks to redress these past injustices and provide opportunities for affected communities to improve their health and well-being.

#### Subject of Equity: {-}
- **Inclusivity:** The subject of equity encompasses all individuals and communities facing health disparities, including marginalized and underserved groups.
- **Generational and Historical Considerations:** An equity-oriented data system takes into account intergenerational and historical factors that have contributed to health disparities. It recognizes that current health outcomes are influenced by past policies and practices.

#### Content of Equity: {-}
- **Procedural Equity:** This aspect of equity focuses on ensuring that the decision-making processes and procedures are perceived as fair and transparent. It involves involving affected communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions.
- **Distributive Equity:** Distributive equity concerns how social welfare and resources are distributed to meet the needs of different populations. It aims to allocate resources in a way that reduces health disparities and provides equitable access to healthcare and other essential services.
- **Contextual Equity:** This aspect acknowledges that pre-existing social conditions (such as poverty, discrimination, and access to resources) influence equity. An equity-oriented data system considers these contextual factors when designing interventions to address health disparities effectively.

### Embracing a Trauma-Informed Mindset in Decision-Making {-}

Adopting a [trauma-informed mindset](https://ncsacw.acf.hhs.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf) is crucial for creating solutions that are sensitive, empathetic, and inclusive when working in the space of communicating, understanding, and analyzing. Trauma-informed decision-making ensures that your project respects the experiences and well-being of individuals whose data is being visualized. Here are key considerations to guide your decision-making process with a trauma-informed approach:

- **Understand the Impact of Trauma:**
Recognize that individuals within your data may have experienced trauma, whether it's related to health disparities, socioeconomic challenges, or other adverse life events. Understanding the potential impact of trauma allows you to approach your project with empathy and compassion.

- **Prioritize Safety and Trust:**
Safety and trust are foundational elements of trauma-informed care. Ensure that your data visualization project creates a safe and trustworthy space for users. This involves transparent communication, data security measures, and a user-friendly interface that minimizes potential triggers.

- **Promote Choice and Empowerment:**
Empower users by providing choices in how they interact with and interpret the data. Consider customizable features that allow individuals to tailor their experience based on their preferences. This promotes a sense of agency and control over their engagement with the visualization.

- **Avoid Re-traumatization:**
Strive to avoid re-traumatization through your data visualizations. Be mindful of the language used, the visual elements displayed, and the overall tone of your project. Aim to present information in a way that informs without causing distress or harm.

- **Cultural Sensitivity and Diversity:**
Acknowledge and integrate cultural sensitivity into your decision-making process. Consider the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences of the individuals represented in the data. Ensure that your visualizations are inclusive and respectful of different cultural perspectives.

- **Engage Stakeholders and Communities:**
Involve stakeholders and communities in the decision-making process. Seek input from those directly impacted by the data being visualized. Community engagement ensures that your project aligns with the real needs and concerns of the people it serves.

- **Continuous Feedback Loops:**
Establish continuous feedback loops to gather insights from users and stakeholders. Regularly reassess your decision-making processes in light of the feedback received, allowing for ongoing improvement and adaptation to the evolving needs of the community.

- **Ethical Data Use and Privacy:**
Uphold ethical standards in data use and privacy protection. Clearly communicate how data will be used, ensuring transparency and obtaining informed consent when necessary. Respect privacy rights and prioritize the responsible and ethical handling of sensitive information.

By embracing a trauma-informed mindset in decision-making, your SDOH data visualization project can contribute to a more compassionate and understanding approach to public health. This mindset not only enhances the user experience but also promotes a positive impact on the well-being of the individuals and communities represented in the data.

## Dynamic Spatial Visualizations 

Visualizing public health data isn't just about the "what"—it's about the "so what?" It's about crafting digital narratives that anyone can access, understand, and use to make a difference. These visual tools are our digital megaphones and meeting places—they bring us together, keep us informed, and push us towards action.  [Data visualizations](https://www.ahrq.gov/data/visualizations/index.html) in public health that advance equity are digital tools designed to provide accessible and comprehensive data related to public health indicators, focusing on reducing health disparities and promoting equity among different populations. These tools often combine various data sources and visualization techniques to present information in a user-friendly and easily understandable format.

Because of our focus on SDOH & Place at neighborhood and regional levels, we'll focus on spatial data visualizations. Spatial data visualizations incorporate not just the "regular" data, but *in addition*, how that data is linked to places. This new dimension of data can be visualized as a map. But another important aspect emerges; with spatial data, we are given the ability to link any data by location. This enables us to integrate the many facets of SDOH and health, converging on place.

![Figure 1.2 - In this dashboard, clicking on a location launches an interactive infographic of detailed health outcomes. Source: [Appsilon](https://connect.appsilon.com/air-quality/)](images/preface-airquality.png)

Data visualizations can be used by community members and organizations, research groups, policymakers, and more to empower individuals to better access and mobilize SDOH data and advance [health equity](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/whatis/index.html).
Within the realm of public health, maps, dashboards, and interactive web applications can be created to foster fairness through an inclusive design that accommodates diverse user groups and their varying degrees of health equity. These tools are not only visually appealing and easy to comprehend, they also provide valuable insights. They adapt to the needs of different social actors by combining well-suited graphics, animations, and audio-visual elements. They even offer networking tools (e.g., messaging boards) for seamless data exchange and user interaction. These interactive features also serve to promptly update users about any alterations.

:::tip
**Tip**

We use the term *spatial data visualizations* throughout the toolkit. We are focusing on web-based applications that will have some interactions. (In other words, they're not just pictures.) There are many other names for what we're talking about, like:

* Web Applications
* Mapping Applications
* Spatial Decision Support Systems

We're not covering all types of spatial data visualizations, or all web apps, but will focus on  common types of web mapping applications. 
:::


## Types of (Spatial) Applications 

Throughout this module, we've concentrated on orienting you to how we talk about SDOH and Place, given you a change to brainstorm ideas, recognize prospective stakeholders, and consider potential data at your disposal for your project As we progress, we will now examine how these three features converge when it comes to choosing an appropriate spatial visualization. To facilitate this, we will introduce four distinct types of spatial visualizations for communicating about and investigating the social determinants of health: asset maps, thematic maps, story maps, and dashboards. 

When comparing spatial visualization options, we'll focus on two dimensions: 1) map type, and 2) level of data & interaction complexity. For map type, visualizations may be more of a **reference** or **thematic** map. A reference map is meant to emphasize *information* about locations, whereas a thematic map will focus on *geographic patterns* of a specific topic. Interaction complexity refers to the intensity and variability of user interaction with the visualization. The interactions may involve a click to open an information window, or may require extensive decision-making and careful parameter selection to generate a updated visualization. Data complexity my refer to how many types of data you are incorporating, from different forms of spatial data (e.g. address-level locations, community boundaries) as well as different types of input data (e.g. photos, videos, tabular data). As applications get more complex, you can also have lines blurred across both dimensions. 

![Figure 1.5 - Types of Spatial Data Visualizations an Web Mapping Applications. Source: HEROP Lab Team](images/preface-map.png)

### Asset Maps {-}
These are like your community's highlight reel, showcasing everything from the vibrant parks and schools to the people who make your area tick. They're about celebrating what's there, not just what's missing, and sparking conversations about building on those strengths. 

Asset maps act as reference maps and tend towards straightforward interactions, like clicking on an icon to access details about an address. Data-wise, asset maps will start with address-level locations, that will get converted to **point** data.

![Figure 1.6 Community Food Map as an Asset Map, Source: [University of Illinois](https://eat-move-save.extension.illinois.edu/#food-finder)](images/intro-food.png){width=80%} 

[Asset mapping](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300351) may involve engaging with community members, stakeholders, and local organizations to gather information and collaboratively build the map. The process can be facilitated through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and public meetings. Alternatively, you may link existing data about resources into a newly integrated platform. The resulting asset map is a visual tool that provides a comprehensive view of the community's strengths, potential partnerships, and areas where support and resources are available. 
The assets included in an asset map can be diverse and encompass various categories, such as:

- **Physical Assets:** These include tangible resources like parks, schools, hospitals, community centers, libraries, public transportation, and other infrastructure elements.

- **Human Assets:** Human resources within the community, such as skilled individuals, volunteers, community leaders, and organizations' staff, are valuable assets.

- **Social Assets:** Social assets refer to the networks, relationships, and social capital present in the community, including support systems, cultural groups, and community organizations.

- **Economic Assets:** These include businesses, local enterprises, job opportunities, and other economic resources that contribute to the community's well-being.

- **Cultural Assets:** The cultural assets encompass the traditions, heritage, arts, and cultural events that enrich the community's identity and cohesion.

- **Environmental Assets:** Natural resources, green spaces, environmental initiatives, and sustainable practices are considered environmental assets.

Asset Maps empower communities, steer strategic planning, and guide resource allocation. They're about networking and flipping the script to a more positive community narrative.

### Simple Thematic Maps {-}
Here's where we paint with data, using colors and symbols to show patterns like disease spread or healthcare access across different places. [Thematic maps](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/gisx/resources/thematic-maps.html) in public health are maps that use visual symbols, colors, and patterns to represent specific health-related data or themes within a geographic area. 

Data-wise, thematic maps use area boundaries, like census tracts or counties, referred to as **polygon** data. Statistical data in CSV formats are merged to spatial data boundaries. Data & interaction complexity remain more simplified, encouraging the user to inspect visualized patterns. Interactions may include selecting different variables for different maps, or clicking on an area to get information in a pop-up window.

![Figure 1.7 - Mapping Climate Risks by County and Community (Source: [Pinkus 2021, via the American Communities Project](https://www.americancommunities.org/mapping-climate-risks-by-county-and-community/))](images/preface-thematic.png){width=100%}  

Thematic maps are valuable tools in public health for conveying complex information in a spatial context, allowing researchers, policymakers, and the public to quickly understand and interpret health-related data. Simple thematic maps in public health are used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Visualizing disease prevalence and distribution

- Identifying health disparities across different regions or demographic groups

- Monitoring disease outbreaks and patterns

- Assessing access to healthcare services and resources

- Evaluating the impact of public health interventions and policies

- Communicating public health information to the general public and stakeholders

Simple thematic maps get straight to the point, showing you who and where are affected by health issues, helping to direct attention and resources effectively. 

### Story Maps {-} 
A [story map](https://ica-abs.copernicus.org/articles/3/245/2021/ica-abs-3-245-2021.pdf) in public health is a powerful and interactive tool that combines maps, text, images, and multimedia elements to tell a compelling narrative about health-related issues, initiatives, or research. Data and interactions may be gorgeously complex, encouraging users to fully imbibe. Different types of spatial data may be used, from point-based locations to regional views. 

These are your digital storybooks, weaving maps with tales and images that take you on a journey through health challenges and triumphs. It allows public health professionals to present complex data, trends, and information in a visually engaging and accessible manner, making it easier for a wide range of audiences to understand and connect with the subject matter. 

![Figure 1.8 - The Mapping of Race in America ([Hessler et al 2023](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac998a8425b54e319f61d34ff1a94a0c))](images/preface-storymap.png){width=90%}  

Key features and uses of story maps in public health include:

- **Data Visualization:** Story maps use maps and data visualizations to illustrate health-related trends, patterns, and disparities across geographic regions. This can include disease prevalence, access to healthcare, environmental health risks, and other relevant data.

- **Narrative Communication:** Story maps are structured to present information in a storytelling format. Public health professionals can use narrative elements to explain the context, significance, and implications of the data, helping the audience grasp the larger story behind the statistics.

- **Health Education and Promotion:** Story maps are an effective educational tool to raise awareness about public health issues, promote healthy behaviors, and disseminate health-related information to the public.

- **Community Engagement:** Story maps can engage communities in public health initiatives by presenting data and insights in a way that is relevant and relatable to specific geographic areas or demographics.

- **Policy Advocacy:** Public health professionals can use story maps to advocate for specific policy changes by visualizing the impact of current policies and proposing evidence-based solutions.

- **Environmental Health:** Story maps can be used to communicate information about environmental health hazards, pollution, and their impact on public health. They can also showcase initiatives aimed at improving environmental conditions and public health outcomes.

- **Outbreak Response and Preparedness:** Story maps can be utilized during disease outbreaks to track the spread of infections, identify hotspots, and inform response efforts.

- **Health Equity and Disparities:** Story maps can highlight health disparities and inequities across different communities and populations, drawing attention to areas with the most significant health challenges and the need for targeted interventions.

Story Maps turn data into engaging tales, educate, and rally communities. They're advocates, educators, and responders all in one.


### Multivariate Data Dashboards {-}
Imagine your health community's stats brought to life in real-time – a dashboard that's part control panel, part story, helping everyone from officials to neighbors make sense of the numbers. Multiple variables will be integrated across different views, enabling a multivariate experience. Interactions can be complex, requiring user input to change figures or update sliders. Data may also be complex, although will mainly focus on statistical tabular data (rather than multimedia formats).

In public health, [data dashboards](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/assets/4472-19438/lessons-learned-dashboard-norc-brief.pdf) are digital tools that provide visual representations of key health-related data and indicators. Here’s an example of a dashboard that highlights users stories, [New Video Series: Moving from Data to Action | City Health Dashboard](https://www.cityhealthdashboard.com/blog-media/1501). These dashboards are specifically designed to present public health data in a user-friendly and easily understandable format, enabling stakeholders, policymakers, researchers, and the general public to access and interpret critical information about population health. 

![Figure 1.8 - The data dashboard was a commonly used tool during the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate community spread and different dimensions of vulnerability. Source: [The US Covid Atlas](https://uscovidatlas.org/map)](images/preface-dashboard.png)

Data dashboards in public health typically include the following features:

- **Health Indicators:** Dashboards display a variety of health indicators, such as disease rates, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, hospitalization rates, environmental health data, and other relevant metrics.

- **Geospatial Data:** Many public health dashboards utilize spatial data to present geostatistical analysis in real-time, allowing users to understand health patterns and disparities across different geographic regions.

- **Time Series Data:** Dashboards often provide data over time, allowing users to observe trends, track changes, and identify seasonal patterns in health outcomes.

- **Demographic Disaggregation:** Public health data dashboards may disaggregate data by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This helps identify disparities and understand how health outcomes vary among different population groups.

- **Comparisons and Benchmarks:** Dashboards may include the ability to compare health outcomes across regions, states, or countries, as well as against national or global benchmarks.

- **Data Sources and References:** Transparent dashboards typically provide information about the sources of data, data collection methods, and references to ensure data credibility.

- **Interactivity:** Interactive elements allow users to customize the dashboard, apply filters, and explore data based on their specific interests and questions.

- **Alerts and Notifications:** Some dashboards include alerting features to notify users about significant changes in health indicators or emerging health threats.

Spatial Data Dashboards keep a pulse on public health, from tracking diseases to zooming in on health equity. They're transparent, interactive, and always on the lookout with alerts.

:::activity
**Activity**

After exploring the four spatial visualizations (e.g., story maps, thematic maps, dashboards, and asset maps), it is essential to reflect on their advantages and limitations. Create a list of three advantages and three limitations for each of the four visualizations that we reviewed in this module.

For example, you could focus on which visualization is better suited for displaying a place's historical health trends, analyzing the impact of a pandemic, or explaining the results of a public policy? Which visualization requires some experience with statistics and coding, and which one requires experience with the humanities and storytelling?

- You may also want to generate a series of digital documents for final **Project Requirements** developed in this module. That may be a series of documents, spreadsheets, or templates identified across online resources.

:::

## What's the Point? 

The goal of this project will be to develop some place-based data visualization or application support that will integrate social determinants of health and an equity framework.

But, what will you *do*, specifically — and *why*? Let's run through some core questions.

**Where** is your application? Is it within a city, neighborhood, or across an entire country? 

- Greater *spatial coverage* does not necessarily mean that your project will get more complex. It may be easier to grab data for all communities within a city from a data portal, for example, than extract data for a single neighborhood. Having more areas available for comparison can also be useful.

- Greater *spatial resolution* does tend to make projects more complicated, on the other hand. You want to explore state policies for 50 states? No problem. Want to grab census tract data for the entire country (all 77,000)? This will limit your visualization options, as some software approaches will be able to handle it with ease, whereas others not all. 

**Who** is your application *about* — a specific population, defined by their residence and/or some social, economic, or other characteristic? And, **Who** is your application *for*? Who will actually be using your application? How and why are they different?

:::pitfall
**Pitfall**

Data may not be available for all places and populations. For example, COVID-19 data by race and ethnicity is still not disaggregated below the state-level for all counties in the U.S (!). You may need to start with your ideal, and then work towards what's actually doable.

:::

- As this toolkit will highlight more than once--it is helpful to work with persons who will actually use the application, *to increase its meaning and utility*. At the same time, it is also helpful to work with persons **who the data is about**, as lived experiences will provide invaluable understanding, depth, and insight into the project of interest. 

**When** is your application being used? Are you focused on the most recent datasets you can find, or are you interested in data over many time periods? And, how will the application itself be changed or updated over time? 

- Consider the *sustainability and long-term maintenance* needs of your project. Where will it be in five years? Would it be okay for the application to exist as a time capsule for a project completed, or do you prefer it to have data updated regularly?

**What** actions should/could result from your application? Are they reasonable, feasible, and time-bound? 

- Do you intend for your interactive asset map of cooling centers to be used by community members during a heat event to find refuge? Are you trying to inspire action from policymakers after exploring your data dashboard of modeled map findings and statistics on health disparities? 

- It is common to start with too ambitious a goal, that will slowly get refined over the project's course of implementation. Try to be realistic and honest when assessing what your final project could do.

**Why** should people care?

- This is often the most important question, and the one least formulated in early stages of the process. Something may be interesting and meaningful to you, but may not be important to others. Or it may be very obvious to you and your peers, but the thought hasn't occurred to others in a different discipline or domain. Be specific and intentional in setting this objective, and do the research. 

Put these together to generate an overview *goal statement* for your project. Include the primary question you’re trying to answer. This may change throughout the process, but should be changed to be refined further, rather than expanded in scope.  

Think of the start of your project as setting out on a road trip. First, you need to map out where you want to go. What do you hope to discover along the way? Your visualization techniques are like choosing the right vehicle for the journey—each has its strengths for different terrains. Your goals will evolve as you travel, finding new paths to explore. But it all starts with a clear destination in mind.

## Refining Goals for SDOH 

Taking your project a step further, dig deeper into how your application can address SDOH directly. Which common approach or technique is the most pertinent to your goals? Consider the following ideas:

 <details markdown='1'><summary>**Identifying Health Disparities**</summary> You can employ spatial visualizations to identify areas with disproportionate health burdens and disparities. For example, by mapping health outcomes and demographic data from the census, it could become evident which communities or populations experience higher rates of diseases or poor health, shedding light on potential health inequities. </br></br></details>
 
  <details markdown='1'><summary>**Targeting Interventions**</summary>  Another option is performing spatial analyses to target interventions and resources to areas with the greatest need. By creating asset maps, you could aid public health advocates to direct their efforts, and allocate resources to address health disparities and promote equity. </br></br></details>
 
  <details markdown='1'><summary>**Assessing Access to Healthcare**</summary> You can produce maps to evaluate the accessibility of healthcare services across different regions. These cartographies identify areas with limited access to medical facilities or services, which is crucial in understanding barriers to healthcare for marginalized populations and addressing health disparities. </br></br></details>
  
   <details markdown='1'><summary>**Modeling SDOH at Different Scales**</summary> You can produce geostatistical analyses to model how social determinants of health (SODH) affect communities at different scales. By studying and mapping these factors, you may better understand how social conditions influence health outcomes and equity. </br></br></details>
   
   <details markdown='1'><summary>**Environmental Justice**</summary> You could create a dashboard to assess environmental health risks and exposures. By combining graphs, maps, and tables you may identify areas with environmental hazards that disproportionately affect specific communities, contributing to health disparities. </br></br></details>
    
  <details markdown='1'><summary>**Health Planning and Policy Interventions**</summary> Your maps can inform stakeholders in their efforts to create effective policies. By deploying various spatial visualizations, you can support interventions targeting specific health challenges in various communities, ultimately promoting health equity.</br></br></details>
  
  <details markdown='1'><summary>**Community Engagement**</summary> Story maps or collaborative mapping projects may facilitate community engagement by providing social experience insights. These representations allow community members to participate in decision-making, voice their concerns, and collaborate with public health officials to design interventions that address their unique needs and concerns. </br></br></details>

  <details markdown='1'><summary>**Monitoring and Evaluation**</summary> Spatio-temporal dashboards are effective tools to monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time. By comparing health outcomes before and after implementing interventions, public health officials can assess whether disparities are decreasing and health equity is improving.</br></br></details>

</br>
Take a moment to consider which goal(s) you have for your project. We recommend starting simple, with no more than one or two goals to start with. Your initial project should focus on accomplishing your primary goal to the greatest of your abilities. Over time, more experience, resources, and support will enable you and your team to expand further.

row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```
</br>

### Integrate Equity Directly {-}

Think back to the equity framework introduced in the first module. While each component is critical to any application built to understand and communicate SDOH, the [**Content of Equity**](https://toolkit.sdohplace.org/01-intro.html#content-of-equity) component can be a useful consideration when building into your goals. Consider how your application may address equity by focusing on one or more of these aspects. Some examples include:

- Integrating community stakeholders directly to the decision-making processes, planning, and implementation of your web application. *(Procedural Equity)*
- Developing an asset map of local health and social services to maximize networking and connection in your city. *(Distributive Equity)*
- Curating a story map that invites users to "walk" through a neighborhood over time as it becomes segregated from highway construction. *(Contextual Equity)*
 
:::activity
**Activity**

Take a look at these three real-world projects. In your own words, sketch out their goals. Do they align with any of the SDOH application goals we've mapped above? What content of equity (procedural, distributive, or contextual) do they address?

- [Data and Stats | Tulsa Health Department](https://www.tulsa-health.org/community-health/data-stats/north-tulsa-medical-provider-and-pharmacy-asset-map)

Next, update your own goal statement based on ideas in this section. What are your SDOH and Equity goals?
:::

:::tip
**Tip**

This is just the beginning of a process. To keep progressing, it's essential to always look for inspiration and stakeholders. Take some time to explore various web maps, dashboards, atlases, magazines, and academic articles. Then, list the ones you find appealing in your journal. Even if they are spatial visualizations that have nothing to do with health, try to imagine how you can use their design to study SDOH.
:::

## Defining Stakeholders 

Once you've got your project's goals on the horizon, it's time to look at who's journeying with you. Collaboration and stakeholder identification are vital components of any project that aims to achieve equity. Whether it's a non-governmental organization, a research group within a university, or a government agency, stakeholders bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the table. Similarly, communities, activists, and advocates can also play a significant role in your project's success. 

<blockquote>Early identification of stakeholders is key to building trust and solidarity, which is a time-consuming but necessary process. </blockquote>

In Module 3, we will delve deeper into employing User-Centered Design to engage stakeholders effectively. The aim will be to ensure that every step of the project, from conception to implementation, is done in collaboration with those who have a vested interest in the outcomes, guaranteeing that the resulting initiatives are equitable, impactful, and sustainable. For now, let's assess your team.


### Assess Your Team {-}

Take an inventory of who makes up your team, and define each person's role. If you are embedded within a larger organization or corporation, there may be expansive stakeholders involved, with multiple stages of review, implementation, and iteration. If you're in a smaller group or you're on your own, you may be taking on several roles at the same time. 

Your core team may include community members directly, or may have a different leadership structure. Here are some critical roles to consider:

```{r table-setstrategy, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
require(pander)
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)
my.data <- "  Responsibilities        | Description
  Set Strategy, Priorities, & Standards     | Core Team, Leadership
  Allocate Resources (Time and $)     | Leadership
  Manage Processes | Core Team, Project Manager 
  Design, Research Use Cases | Core Team, Designer
  Develop, Deploy, & Monitor Project | Core Team, Engineer
  Use the application in way that was expected | Expected Users
  Use the application in way that was uexpected  | Unexpected Users
"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,])) # put headers on
df <- df[-1,] # remove first row
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```

There are two additional stakeholders every application developer should consider -- the Champion, and the Curmudgeon, which are actual roles that have been used in *Health Informatics*. 

Considering them will be essential for your success:

- **The Champion** - They love your idea, sing its praises, and are ready to share your work with everyone they know. They may not get the "tech stuff" completely, and won't have time to learn it if they wanted to, but are your biggest cheerleader. They may help you get funding.

- **The Curmudgeon** - They prefer to do things the way they have always been doing it. It's generally something they do themselves, and probably manually. They are not interested in your work, and may challenge it with a sigh, eye-roll, or outright lament. May prefer technology the way it "used" to be.

We caution that you not shift your work too much in either direction to please/antagonize either of these stakeholders, but rather understand their role in the process at this stage. 

:::activity

### Motivations {-}
If you find yourself to be a "curmudgeon" at the idea of working with others to support your journey, we also encourage you to take a moment to consider all the benefits of engaging more stakeholders.

Here’s how a wider stakeholder alliance can shape your journey:

- **Understanding Diverse Perspectives:** Stakeholders come from various backgrounds and sectors, each bringing unique insights that can challenge and enrich your project's approach to health. A government official might understand policy implications, while a local activist might provide a grassroots perspective on community health challenges.

- **Data Gathering and Validation:** Collaborators are crucial in both collecting and validating SDOH data. They ensure that the information reflects real-world conditions and is relevant to the communities affected. Researchers can provide rigorous methodologies, while community members can offer qualitative insights that ground the data in lived experiences.

- **Expanding the Network:** Engaging with stakeholders allows for the expansion of your network. Each stakeholder may introduce you to other relevant parties, broadening the reach and potential impact of your project. This can lead to discovering untapped resources or finding new avenues for support and advocacy.

- **Exploring New Contexts:** Stakeholders can act as guides through unfamiliar territories, both metaphorically in the project domain and literally in the community spaces. They help navigate the cultural, social, and political landscapes that shape health outcomes.

- **Innovative Co-Design:** Utilizing User-Centered Design principles, stakeholders become co-creators in developing spatial visualizations that represent SDOH. Their input ensures that the end products are not only technically sound but also culturally sensitive and user-friendly.

- **Forging Partnerships:** Collaboration can lead to long-term partnerships that extend beyond the life of a single project. These relationships can build a foundation for future initiatives, creating a sustainable impact on public health.

- **Revising Project Goals:** Stakeholders often provide new insights that can lead to a reframing of project goals. What begins as a narrow focus on a particular health issue might evolve into a more holistic approach that considers a wider range of social factors.

- **Ensuring Equity:** By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, the project is more likely to address equity in a meaningful way. Equity is not just about equal access, it's also about designing interventions that acknowledge and address power imbalances and historical contexts that contribute to health disparities.

### Finding a Community of Practice {-}

Even if you think you're getting into this solo or with a smaller team, you may be surprised at the number of people available to connect with you as invaluable colleagues, future friends, and mentors in your network. You've found this project -- that already means you're a part of a wider community of practice. Join our [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14406296/) and [**GitHub**](#) pages to introduce yourself and expand your network. Additionally, consider sharing your ideas with people in your community, whether that be your neighborhood, school, or work.

We love this [**Mentor Map**](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/files/files/Mentoring%20Map%5B1%5D(1).pdf) exercise by the *National Center for Faculty Development & Diversity* -- not just for academic folks, but anyone who has a beating heart and is working on a project. Try out the exercise yourself to identify persons in your network who you may be reach out to connect for feedback, accountability, intellectual discussions, and emotional support as you work through the project. 
:::

## Project Assessment

You now know what you want to do, and who you want to do it with. You've gathered your team and had a few good discussions. If you're on your own, you've made a list of mentors and additional resources to connect with so you can ensure feedback throughout the process.

Let's finish scoping this project.

### Assess Your Strengths {-}

Each project will require **domain expertise** and **technical capacity**. Domain expertise means they are subject matter experts (SME). For example, someone who has been a 6th grade English teacher for 5 years, can be considered a SME of teaching 6th grade English. Technical capacity will refer to those people who know how to code from the back end (what only the core team sees) to the front end (what your users see).

Which is your strength, and which will you need to skill up to further support for project implementation? 

For example: 

- If your project is about building an asset map to support populations experiencing food insecurity, you may be a food bank volunteer who has worked directly with populations impacted, live in the community, and also would be using the application with collaboration from the regional food pantry network. In this case, you have extensive domain expertise and knowledge that will be more enriched than most web app developers, assuming you are not a developer for your day job. For this project, you will be the SME and need to find someone who has the technical capacity needed for the project *or* your goal will be to scale up your technical capacity within the constraints of your setting. 

- On the other hand, perhaps you are a graduate student who has been coding statistical models for your work, and are interested in adding more social impact to your work. You’re used to learning new programming languages for new projects, and have a high technical capacity, but are not embedded within the community you want to build an asset map for. For this project, you would be the technical expert and need to find a SME *or* your goal will be to scale up your understanding of equity based frameworks, learning more about community experiences, as well as researching the topic further to build your domain expertise. 

After assessing your strengths, go back to your list of stakeholders and update as needed. 

:::tip
**Tip**

As you expand your stakeholder team, your project may update according to shared goals and visions of team members. As a result, your team will work through the assessment process more than once. This iterative process is expected.
:::

:::activity
**Activity**

Write down your purpose and objectives by clearly stating why you want to solve this problem and what you hope to achieve. Who is your target audience? 

Next, make a list of your potential stakeholders. How would you contact your stakeholders and why would they be interested in collaborating with you? Would you be part of an ongoing project or propose a new one?

The format for this exercise is flexible and exploratory. You can opt to create lists of objectives, draw diagrams, write a structured plan, or engage in a free-writing exercise.

The primary aim of this task is to develop a foundation to begin exploring spatial data for your project. It's important to note that your final prototype might diverge significantly from what you record in this entry, and that's perfectly acceptable. Remember, the process of using SDOH spatial data for visualizations is a dynamic process.
:::

### Assess Project Needs {-}

Project Needs will include data, computer services, time, and attitude. To assess this, you will need to survey your motivation and pain points, as well as technical, financial, people, and time resources. 

- **Data**: What data do you have, and what will you need to find? How comfortable are you working with data, and what is the state of data where you are now? Do you curate community resources on post-it notes, PDFs, spreadsheets, or databases? Consider taking a [data maturity assessment](https://data.org/dma/) to better understand your data strategy along dimensions of purpose, practice, and people. Take your data skills a notch or two to the next level, progressing with patience, rather than jumping into a complex warehousing project that could be overkill.

- **Computing Resources**: Do you have expansive computing resources and software available to you (e.g. large university of industry environment), or are you seeking free and/or low cost computing solutions? If you're developing a project for a team member at a different institution, can they access the technical resources needed, or would they need to purchase a costly subscription? Knowing what resources are available to you is essential for selecting the best approach for app development.

- **Community**: Are you working within an isolated environment, or do you have multiple colleagues who are ready to help? Perhaps you're surrounded by people, but everyone is already overstretched with their work. At the same time, who will take over the project when you've moved on — are there interns, analysts, or volunteers interested in learning from your findings? Identify your needs.

- **Attitude**: This facet is also crucial, and can help you decide which adventure to choose in later modules. If troubleshooting coding bugs like tasty puzzles sounds fun, take the coding route, even if you've never seen yourself as a coder. If you just want to get through the application building process as fast as possible to move on to a different project, go for a software-based option instead. You may find yourself to be a *prototyper*, enjoying the process of building a project; or an *optimizer*, instead wanting to refine pieces until they are perfect. The best teams have both! 

Consider **sustainability** at this stage. What will your project look like in five years? 


### Is there an app for that? {-}

In the ever-evolving landscape of data visualization and technology, it's essential to explore existing tools and applications before embarking on a new project. This not only saves time and resources but also allows you to benefit from the wealth of solutions that may already address your needs. Here are some ideas to help you determine if there's an app or web visualization that aligns with your SDOH data visualization project:

- **Research Existing Solutions**
Start by conducting thorough research on existing data visualization tools and applications. Look for platforms that specialize in healthcare, public health, or social determinants of health. Consider both general-purpose visualization tools and those specifically designed for SDOH.

- **Collaborate and Network**
Connect with professionals in the field of public health and data visualization. Attend conferences, webinars, or join online forums where experts discuss SDOH projects. Networking can provide valuable insights into tools that have been successfully used in similar projects.

- **Evaluate Open Source Solutions**
Consider open-source visualization tools and frameworks. Open-source projects often have active communities and can be tailored to specific needs. GitHub and other repositories are great places to explore such solutions.

- **Consult with Peers and Stakeholders**
Reach out to colleagues, peers, and stakeholders involved in similar projects. They might have insights into tools that have proven effective in their work. Collaboration can lead to shared resources and knowledge.

- **Check for Integration Capabilities**
If your project involves integration with existing systems or databases, ensure that the identified tools have the necessary integration capabilities. Compatibility with data sources is crucial for a seamless visualization experience.

- **Consider Customization and Scalability**
Assess whether the existing tools can be customized to meet the specific requirements of your SDOH data visualization project. Additionally, evaluate their scalability to accommodate potential future expansions or changes in data sources.

- **Evaluate Cost and Licensing**
Analyze the cost implications and licensing requirements of using existing tools. Some applications may be free, while others might have subscription fees or licensing agreements. Factor in your budget constraints when making a decision.

By thoroughly exploring existing solutions, you can make informed decisions about whether to build from scratch or leverage the capabilities of existing apps and web visualizations for your SDOH project. Remember, a well-researched approach can lead to more efficient and impactful data visualization outcomes.

## Finalize Approach

The field of project management is vast, interdisciplinary, and always growing. Here are some highlights that can go a long way in scoping your project effectively and finalizing goals In these steps, you'll move from ideas to a concrete plan.

### Define SMART Goals {-}

You've already sketched out a few goals for your project, including an overview and SDOH-specific plans. Now let's get specific. Establish SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals or similar criteria for the project to ensure clarity and effectiveness:

**Specific:** Clearly define the objectives and outcomes of the project.

**Measurable:** Set quantifiable metrics to assess progress and success.

**Achievable:** Ensure that goals are realistic and feasible within the project scope.

**Relevant:** Align project goals with the overall purpose and objectives.

**Time-Bound:** Define specific timelines for the completion of key milestones and the entire project.

Check out resources at the end of this module for more examples of SMART goals & resources.

### Define Requirements {-}

**System Requirements** Based on the inventory of your project assessment above, you're ready to generate a list of system requirements. Identify major *system capabilities* (e.g. must use free or opensource technologies; must integrate new data contributed with approval), *system assumptions or constraints* (e.g. you will have access to colleagues for support; you have a limited budget and time to accomplish goals), *user characteristics*, and any other requirements. 

Review your project needs, your own strengths, and stakeholder needs defined earlier in this module. You may find multiple templates online for ideas.

**User Requirements** Identify the goals for your intended audience. Be specific about the types of interaction you have in mind. Following are a number of potential options, with increasing complexity:

- Implement a user-friendly interface with features like drop-down selection, click for pop-up windows, and storytelling to enhance access to information. 
- Ensure that users can easily explore relevant data points and insights related to social determinants of health (SDOH) within their specified areas. 
- Incorporate interactive elements such as sliders and number entry fields to allow users to input specific parameters, enabling a more personalized and focused exploration of the data.
- Design the application to respond dynamically to user inputs, providing real-time visualizations and insights based on the selected criteria.

:::tip
**Word of the Day: *Affordances* **

These user behaviors, like anticipated clicks or zooming to view, are called *affordances* in the design space. Affordances are clues that an object can be used to perform some action. If you see what looks like a button on the internet, you may want to click it. If you see a slider, you may want to slide it.

Designing products well take *affordances* into account. In this stage of planning, you're engineering things so that your audience will know what to do intuitively, based on these visual cues. A deeper dive into the topic can be found at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/affordance-most-underrated-word-in-web-design/).

:::

### Break Down Details {-}

**Generate a Timeline**

- Develop a detailed timeline outlining the various stages of the project, from data preparation and analysis to application development and deployment.

- Clearly define milestones and deadlines to track progress effectively.

**Task Breakdown**

- Break down the project into manageable tasks and subtasks, assigning responsibilities to team members based on their expertise.

- Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and critical paths to ensure a smooth workflow.

**Process Documentation**

- Establish a systematic approach to document the entire process, including data preparation steps, analysis methodologies, and application development strategies.

- Maintain a comprehensive record of decisions made, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented throughout the project.

**Communication Plan**

- Develop a communication plan that outlines how team members and stakeholders will stay informed about project progress.

- Define regular check-ins, status updates, and channels for effective communication within the team.

### Enable Agile Processes {-}

While there are many project management styles out there, we recommend approaches that allow for regular updates and revisions. The traditional "waterfall" method of developing a project on your own and delivering it one go is not realistic for complex spatial data visualization work about SDOH & Place, as you'll miss crucial engagements and opportunities for improvement along the way. 

We recommend embracing "agile" methodologies to foster flexibility and adaptability in project execution, especially the processes of iterative development and user-centered design.

#### Iterative Development {-}

- Implement an iterative development approach, allowing for continuous refinement and improvement based on feedback and evolving requirements.

- Conduct regular sprint cycles to review and adjust project goals, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations.

#### User-Centered Design{-}

- Prioritize user feedback and engagement throughout the development process, incorporating user-centered design principles.

- Conduct usability testing to gather insights into user preferences and refine the application interface accordingly.

By establishing clear deliverables and defining an agile and well-documented process, the project can proceed systematically and effectively, addressing the identified objectives and stakeholder needs.

:::activity
**Activity**

Establish your final Project Requirements, based on the assessment completed in this module. They should include:

- Your project overview
- Your project goals & objectives
- System Requirements 
- User Requirements
- Timeline

Indicate which project management approach you'll be adopting. Include a few sentences to describe your process and communications plan. This will be a work in progress, so feel free to update as you go!

# Human Centered Design

:::objective
**Objectives**

In this module, you will: 

- Describe the fundamental concepts of Human-Centered Design

- Analyze various design elements (e.g., graphic icons, layout, text fonts)

- Create a user interface prototype

:::

Picture yourself not just as a creator, advocate, policymaker, or researcher but also as a storyteller and a listener. In this module, you're going to learn the ropes of Human-Centered Design (HCD)—it's all about making sure our designs click with the very people they're meant for. We're talking about a real connection.

> The primary objective of a successful data visualization method should be to meet the needs of the individuals who will be using it.

This entails understanding their objectives in using web applications, their situations, and their familiarity levels. It's essential to determine the design approaches that would most effectively cater to these requirements. Not planning appropriately can lead to revising the design which would eventually slow you down from releasing the application you have in mind. Therefore, a crucial first step of any data visualization planning process is to identify the users and understand what they want out of the visualization. 

## Design Methods

Let's dive into the world of design methodologies, where each approach brings something special to the table. Our star player here is **Human-Centered Design (HCD)**, a method that puts people at the heart of the design process. HCD is all about getting into the users' shoes, understanding what they need and want, and then crafting solutions that hit the mark. But that's not the whole story. We're also going to peek into some other relevant and overlapping design methods, each with its flavor:

<!-- ```{r table-simple, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- require(pander) -->

## Human-Centered Design

Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a well-researched framework that provides a set of guidelines and processes to ensure that designs cater to the desires, abilities, and contexts of their potential end users. Our focus is on HCD as it guides the designer in you to to empathize with users, understand their needs, wants, and experiences, and create designs that engage and adapt to the context of their real lives. Employing HCD can also reduce the risk of negative outcomes and enhance user well-being.

Applications of HCD principles have generated a design process that shares the following three steps:

![](images/hcd-steps.png){width=95%}

Throughout these steps, the designer will constantly 'diverge' their ideas to think wide and open while 'converge' their scope and prototype with focus.

### Identifying User Needs {-}
The first step of the HCD process is to understand what a user hopes to accomplish and the conditions that will allow them to do so. 

To determine user needs, inclusive workshops are an effective way of bringing users into the design process and empowering them to share their goals for the tool as well as their particular concerns and contexts that might shape their use of the application. The success of these workshops depends on how well the participants represent a potentially **diverse end-user group**: to best understand the true breadth of needs to be considered, users of all different backgrounds, experience levels, and goals must be given equal opportunity to provide insight.

Establishing common terminology with workshop participants is necessary as they may not be familiar with application design or data discovery. Therefore, certain functionalities must be explained with examples to allow participants to articulate what sorts of features they may benefit from.

Workshops can be organized in a way that is feasible and comfortable for all:

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Virtual workshop**</summary>
Virtual meetings (over Zoom, for example) are an effective way to hold these workshops. Virtual meetings allow for a broader spectrum of users to participate. In these meetings, it is recommended to include multimodal communication, such as a mix of presentations, live discussions, polling, and a chat function. This ensures that participants with varying levels and preferences of engagement get an opportunity to speak their minds.
<br/><br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**In-person workshop**</summary>
If you’re lucky that all your users are available for an in-person workshop, then using a whiteboard, sticky notes, and other stationery is recommended.
<br/><br/></details>

Free online platforms are available to enable a collaborative brainstorming session to determine user needs, be it virtual or in-person. FigJam and Miro, for example, are free online collaboration tools that allow users to brainstorm and organize ideas, allowing for real-time interactive sessions between team members.

Making User Personas

One of the most effective ways to get started with identifying user needs is to create details around each *user persona*. This way, you can not only test the assumptions that you make about your personas but also see how far you can ideate on their potential needs. The primary object is to understand the personas by gaining a deep understanding of their **needs, preferences, behaviors, and goals.** This understanding is crucial for developing the application in the direction that resonates with their needs. 

During the exercise, personas are looked at from a more humanized lens that helps build empathy as it is easier to relate to a fictional character representing a real user than to an abstract persona. We recommend using the User Persona FigJam template to collaborate and build a meaningful set of user personas, for which steps are provided:

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 1: Accessing FigJam and load the User Persona FigJam template**</summary>

1. Go to the [Figma website](https://www.figma.com/) and sign in or create a new account. - If you don't have an account, click on "Sign Up" to create a new account. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process. You can choose a free account, but if you have the chance, pick the academic account since it provides more perks. 

2. Once you sign up, Figma will lead you to your personal workspace. Under Teams (left part of the screen), select “Create new team.” Name your new team as you like, we will name it “Place Project.” You can skip adding your collaborators and choose the starter option.  

![Figma homescreen](images/hcd-1.2.png){width=90%} 

3. Once you have your new team, access the [User Persona FigJam template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1027357893837345723/user-persona) webpage and click on the "open in Figjam" button. This action will open the template into your own work space.

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 2: Edit the User Persona Template**</summary>

1. Once the template is open, you'll see a canvas with predefined sections for different aspects of a user persona (e.g., demographics, goals, frustrations). Take a few minutes to explore this template. You can zoom into specific sections. 

![Template opened in own work space](images/hcd-2.1.png){width=90%} 


2. You will see the name of the file on the top of the canvas. The default name is "User persona (community)" Click on the arrow and choose “rename.” You may name your new file "Place Project - User Personas," but you can pick your own name. Click on the arrow once again and pick “move to project” and move your file under the team you created on Step 1.2 of this guide. 
   
![Moving to team project folder](images/hcd-2.2.png){width=90%} 

3. Now that your file is in the correct project, click on each section on the canvas to edit the text and add details relevant to your potential user personas. You may change the image of your personas, change their personality traits by moving the sliders, and write on the sticky notes their interests, motivations, goals, pain points and frustrations etc. 

![User persona](images/hcd-2.3.png){width=90%} 

4. You can also use the drawing tools, sticky notes, and connectors (below of the screen) to enhance the visual representation of your user personas.

5. You can also copy and paste different elements of this template. For example, right click on the "Basic Information Section," paste it on the canvas and move this section just below your first persona. Do the same with the "More about'' section. Now, you can have multiple personas with different skills, motivations, and personalities. 

![Multiple user personas](images/hcd-2.5.png){width=90%} 

6.  FigJam automatically saves your work, but it's a good practice to save manually the version history as well. Perhaps you may want to come back to a previous version of your template. Click on the main menu icon in the top-left corner and choose "file" then select "Save to version history" and follow the instructions. 

</br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 3: Collaborate with Others**</summary>

1. FigJam is designed for collaboration. Click on the "Share" button in the top-right corner to invite some of your colleagues of the Place Project Fellowship to provide you feedback in real-time. You can use their emails or provide them with a link to your canvas. 

2. You may use sticky notes to communicate and work together in order to refine your user personas. However, another way to do it is by clicking on the "Add comment" (e.g., speech globe) icon at the top of the canvas, selecting where you want to add the comment on the canvas and writing it. 

![Tagging and adding a comment](images/hcd-3.2.png){width=90%} 

</br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 4: Save and Export**</summary>

If you need to share the user personas outside of FigJam, you can export the file by clicking on the “Main Menu" icon, selecting "File" and "Export as" to choose your desired format (PDF, JPG. PNG etc).

</br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 5: Iterate and Refine**</summary>

1. User personas are dynamic, and your project may evolve. Use FigJam to iterate and refine your user personas as needed.

2. Collaborate with your team at the Place Project  to gather feedback and make improvements to ensure the personas accurately reflect your target audience.

3. On your own try to create at least three potential User Personas for your project and share it with your Place Project colleagues. Also do not forget to provide some feedback to them.

Congratulations! You've successfully used a FigJam template to create user personas for your project. Feel free to explore other FigJam features to enhance your collaborative design process.

### Designing to User Needs {-}

The next step of the HCD process is to determine a web application design that will meet user needs. An application's user interface is a key element of design for developers to consider.

#### Organize Functions {-}
To involve users in the process of creating the application interface, **card sorting** is one effective method of participatory design, in which users are given note cards representing application functions and are asked to arrange them in ways they would find most easily to navigate on a web page. Creating a full list of functions that will help users meet their goals, such as the ability to query a dataset using keywords, or zoom in on particular locations in a map, is a helpful first step of this process.

![Card sorting for a food access project](images/cardsorting.png){width=90%} 

During the card sorting activity, don't hesitate to create, remove, or edit cards that may be suggested by the users. This technique often serves as a guidance for taking the next step, but you should feel free to adapt and improvise as needed. Application developers should also consider how data will be organized into meaningful categories. For health equity applications, for example, it is often useful to divide data by demographics.


#### Design Aesthetics {-}
The design of graphic icons, buttons, window layouts, symbols, text fonts, and color schemes is also crucial to this step. Researchers have identified certain principles of design that seem to be broadly visually appealing and successful. These include:

- Navigation tools should be highly visible, intuitive, & consistently placed

- Writing should be presented in readable blocks

- Text should be easy to read and appropriate size, color, and font

- Elements should be organized in an understandable structure denoted by meaningful headings

- Images should be relevant, clear, and properly sized

Overall layout should be minimalist, uncluttered, and balance color with an effective use of white space.

#### Design Tools {-}

Starting with design tools, using a pen and paper for making paper prototypes offers a great starting point. This allows for rapidly translating ideas into tangible and shareable prototypes, helping make quick iterations.

Alternatively or additionally, you could opt to make low or mid-fidelity prototypes. Low-fidelity prototypes are rudimentary representations of design concepts, helping explore and communicate ideas without delving into specifics. On the other hand, mid-fidelity prototypes offer a more refined depiction of the final product. Here are some simple to use low-fidelity design tools:

- [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com/): MockFlow is a versatile web tool ideal for creating wireframes, user flows, and prototypes with its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members.

- [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/): Wireframe.cc offers a minimalist approach to wireframing, allowing users to quickly sketch out ideas and concepts in a clean and straightforward manner, making it perfect for rapid ideation and iteration.

![](images/prototypes.png){width=100%}

Moving further, high-fidelity prototypes mirror the end product closely in terms of design, interactions, and functionality. Making these require more time and resources to develop. There are a variety of tools freely available on the internet to collaboratively design high-fidelity user interface prototypes. Several options include:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): A collaborative design tool often used for user interface design. Figma is entirely browser-based and includes many helpful design tools, adaptable templates, and allows for real-time collaboration.

- [Wondershare Mockitt](https://mockitt.wondershare.com/home.html): Similar to Figma, Mockitt includes a wide variety of design tools, but may be an easier platform to use for design beginners.

- [Quant-UX](https://www.quant-ux.com/): Quant-UX is an open-source design tool similar to the above platforms, but includes features that allow for usability testing and analysis.

If you find the platform confusing or limiting, try out another and compare. Also, visit design mockup websites such as [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) to search for creative inspiration on user interface design.
:::


### Evaluation and Iteration {-}

The next step of the HCD process is to evaluate how usable, accessible, and satisfying the initial web application design is for users. To do so, it is crucial to solicit feedback through user testing and evaluation. An effective method of evaluation is to have users test out a prototype of the design and give feedback on their experience.

#### Heuristic Evaluation {-}

Before bringing the users back in the loop, there is plenty of testing you can do yourself to ensure usability of your application. Heuristic evaluation is often considered as a fast and inexpensive method to highlight usability issues early on. The analysis can also be optionally done with users that may involve observing and taking more granular feedback. Following are 10 usability heuristics that can help you to quickly evaluate your application:

![](images/heuristics.png){width=100%} 
<details markdown='1'><summary>**More details on each Heuristic**</summary>
```{r table-simple, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
require(pander)
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)
my.data <- "Heuristic | Description

Visibility of System Status | Keep users constantly updated on what the system is doing. Offer clear feedback on their actions and system responses promptly, ensuring they're always aware of the current state.

Match between System & Real World	| Speak the user's language and organize information in a way that mirrors how they think and operate in the real world. Use familiar terms and conventions to guide users through the interface seamlessly.

User Control & Feedback | Empower users to navigate the system with ease and confidence. Provide intuitive ways for users to backtrack or exit undesirable states or actions, giving them a sense of control and freedom over their interactions.

Consistency & Standards	| Maintain uniformity throughout the interface, ensuring that similar elements behave predictably and are represented consistently. Adhere to established design patterns and standards to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

Error Prevention | Design the system to anticipate and prevent user errors whenever possible. Implement safeguards such as confirmation dialogs to mitigate the risk of unintended actions and provide a safety net for users to catch mistakes before they happen.

Recognition rather than Recall | Present information and options in a way that reduces the cognitive load on users, minimizing the need for them to recall details from memory. Make relevant cues and instructions readily visible to guide users through their interactions effortlessly.

Flexibility & Efficiency of Use | Cater to users of varying skill levels by offering shortcuts or customization options to streamline their tasks. Allow users to tailor their experience to suit their preferences, making interactions more efficient and accommodating their individual needs.

Aesthetic & Minimalist Design	| Strive for simplicity and elegance in the interface, focusing on essential elements while eliminating unnecessary clutter. Create a visually pleasing environment that enhances usability by directing users' attention to what matters most.

Help Users with Errors | Communicate errors clearly and constructively, using plain language to explain the problem and offering actionable solutions to resolve it. Guide users through the error-recovery process smoothly, helping them troubleshoot and recover with confidence.

Help & Documentation | Provide accessible and user-friendly help resources for users seeking assistance. Offer clear, concise documentation that addresses common questions and concerns, empowering users to find answers and guidance whenever they need it."

df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,])) # put headers on
df <- df[-1,] # remove first row
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```
</br></details>

:::activity
**Activity**

Rapid-fire Heuristics Evaluation

Spend 5 minutes conducting a usability heuristics analysis on your preferred website or application, utilizing the provided heuristics. **Pay attention to the details.** Then, expand this exercise to another website, repeating the evaluation process. Look for similarities or differences between the two. For a deeper understanding, focus on applications similar to those you're interested in creating. 

This activity offers valuable insights into heuristic application and user experience, aiding in the enhancement of your own application design.
:::

#### Interviews & Surveys {-}

The best form of feedback is the one coming straight from your users. Evaluations can be conducted live by bringing a group of users together for in-person or remote interviews by having them think aloud as they navigate through your application. They could also share their qualitative feedback using a focus group setting. On the other hand, conducting online surveys can help gather quantitative feedback.

Across evaluations, it is important to administer a set of background questions to understand users' demographics, their roles or occupations, and their overall goals to understand how individuals across different contexts differ in how usable they find the web application. The questions users are asked should allow you to evaluate the extent to which the application meets established user needs and the extent to which the application is usable.

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Interviews**</summary>

Interviews demand thorough planning and execution, whether conducted face-to-face or remotely.

A helpful strategy is to structure questions logically. Begin with broader inquiries to encourage participants to think broadly. As the conversation progresses, gradually transition to more specific questions. When wrapping up, ensure there's space for open-ended inquiries, allowing participants to share anything not covered. Interviews include a range of questions covering the following aspects:

- Introduction: Background, primary responsibilities or tasks, ways to interact

- Needs & Pain Points: Main challenges, recent experience, frustrations, specific features

- Usage & Experience: Frequency, likes and dislikes

- Feedback: Rate overall satisfaction, improvements expected, anything else, likely to recommend?

These questions can serve as a starting point for conducting user interviews, but it's essential to adapt and refine them based on your application and the goals you have for the interview.

Furthermore, incentives can be essential for securing interview sign-ups. Consider consulting your organization or manager to explore potential compensation methods for participants' time.

</br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Surveys**</summary>

Surveys are generally the least resource-intensive method of evaluation. When designing a usability survey, it is crucial to ask questions that will shed light on how usable, enjoyable, and effective individuals find the tool. These surveys can include a mix of multiple-choice, ratings, and open-response questions. Examples include:

- What are your main objectives when using this tool? Were you able to meet those goals?

- What features do you use most?

- How easily navigable did you find the interface? Was it visually appealing?

- What would you like to see change (or stay the same) about the tool?

There are many online platforms to create surveys:

- Google Forms is a free, easy-to-use tool that allows for unlimited questions and offers a full range of question types. Google Forms will not analyze the data collected.

- Qualtrics is a more powerful tool for survey design and can generate a quantitative analysis of the data. Qualtrics includes a free option, however, there is a steeper learning curve to creating these surveys than a tool like Google Forms.

- Using printed sheets with survey questions can also work if the setup is in-person.
Based on the survey respondents and their level of comfort, their responses may need to be recorded anonymously.

</br></details>

:::pitfall
**Pitfall**

Neglecting IRB Guidelines

Beware of potential pitfalls when gathering feedback. Ensure that your chosen method aligns with IRB or institutional approval guidelines for research involving human subjects. Neglecting this could lead to privacy breaches or ethical concerns. Additional measures like encryption and secure data storage may be necessary to safeguard sensitive information. It's always good to check before proceeding.
:::

#### Iteration {-}

Following evaluation, you should revise the application accordingly, and re-evaluate and redesign until user needs are sufficiently satisfied. Constantly keeping in touch with stakeholders and users make it easier to design for them. Lastly, try accommodating as much feedback but don't let it come in the way of you from moving forward to the next steps.

## Good Design

Human-Centered Design (HCD) is all about putting users first, but at the end of the day, its core objective remains aligned with broader design principles.  Whether you stick strictly to HCD methods or embrace a more adaptable approach, the overarching goal is to produce designs of high caliber that really work for users. Ultimately, the aim is to deliver a positive user experience. The following are key attributes that are associated with good design:

![](images/good-design.png){width=100%}

```{r table-simples, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
require(pander)
panderOptions('table.split.table', Inf)
my.data <- "Attribute | Description

Useful | It must be original and meet a specific need

Usable | The application should be straightforward to navigate

Desirable | Images, branding, other elements should create an emotional connection

Findable | Content should be easy to find within the site and from external sources

Accessible | The content must be accessible to individuals with disabilities

Credible | Information provided should be trustworthy and believable to the user
"

df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,])) # put headers on
df <- df[-1,] # remove first row
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown')
```

# Spatial Data Wrangling 

:::objective
**Objectives**

In this module, you will:

* Introduction to spatial data concepts and operations
* Convert CSV lat/long to spatial points and geocode address
* Overlay points with boundary data, merge SDOH data, visualize as thematic map
* Gain insight into SDOH data resources
:::

You've spent some time visioning your project goals, breaking down specific needs, and connecting with potential users of the application. Once you've done these things, you're ready to take on the data at hand, and start wrangling.

What sort of data will you be working with? Some examples could include:

- **Resource or asset data**: This could be a spreadsheet of locations including their names, description, category, and address. For data wrangling, you'll want to set this dataset up as a .CSV format to start. This may be used as a primary dataset for an asset map.

- **Tabular, statisical, or "flat-file" data**: This could be a CSV, TXT, or XLSX format dataset filled with details on income, education, or housing estimates by county. It could be data on health outcomes, with each row corresponding to a different time point. You may have downloaded it directly from a data portal, or extracted from the Census. You may use this data for thematic maps, dashboards, and more.

- **Multi-media data**: This could be photographs, videos, or stories that you have geo-tagged to specific locations. It can be used for story maps, and more.

Because we're working with place-based SDOH data, that means learning how to handle *spatial data.* (This may involve converting non-spatial data to spatial data.) Working with spatial data is like working with regular data, plus entirely new dimensions. The data formats are different, and you'll need different tools to work with it. 

## Environment Setup

:::tools
**Tools**

*Download the Activity Datasets*

While you will use your own data for your project, practice with ours. Please download and unzip this file to get started: [SDOHPlace-DataWrangling.zip](https://github.com/healthyregions/sdohplace-toolkit/raw/main/data/SDOHPlace-DataWrangling.zip)
:::

Which computing environment should you work with spatial data? It's up to you — there are many options to choose from today. Our toolkit focuses on free and opensource tools, and/or tools that are widely available with low cost. In this chapter, we'll work with *QGIS*, *Excel*, and *GeoDa.* In the Appendix, you'll find the same activities using *R programming* scripts.

:::tools

**Tools**

For this module, you need the following installed on your machine. A recent, stable version is sufficient; note that versions will be updated regularly, so you'll need to learn to update, manage, and troubleshoot as you go. 

- **QGIS**: QGIS is a free, opensource geographic information system that can be used to create, map, and analyze geospatial data. Download QGIS [here](https://qgis.org/en/site/).
- **Excel**: Excel is a spreadsheet software that can store, organize, and analyze data sets. Use a free online version [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/free-productivity-apps#free-benefits).
- **GeoDa**: GeoDa is a free, opensource GIS tool, designed to be an introductory tool for spatial data science. Download GeoDa [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/).

If you prefer to code, or want to practice coding, go to the [Appendix]() to learn the same materials using the R Programming Language. 
:::


Throughout, you'll learn the tool you're using isn't as important as your ideas, concepts, and goals. You can merge data, run a buffer analysis, and make a map using ESRI, QGIS, R, Python, Spatial SQL or any other number of software or coding languages. Your goal is to learn what you want to do, understand why you need to do it, and learn & discover as you go.

That being said, data wrangling takes up **at least 80%** of a traditional GIS/spatial analysis project. Don't underestimate the time needed to resolve challenges, and practice patience.

### Installing & Working with Software {-}

All three software that you'll be introduced to have extensive documentation to help users understand the tools available to them and troubleshoot issues they come across. This documentation can be found [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html) for QGIS, [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel) for Excel, and [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/documentation.html) for GeoDa.

In addition to these official documentation sources, search engines are your best friend. Gravitate toward answers on community-driven forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [GIS Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/), because someone else will have likely experienced your problem before. Searching the issue you run into or the error message that you receive is likely to bring up a forum thread of people who worked to resolve the same issue.

:::tip

**Tip**

- If possible, it's best to copy/paste specific error messages (or "stack traces") from your software into search engines to find the most relevant result.
- *Google* tends to be the most common search engine used by developers, so may be most likely to give you the result you need.
- Sometimes information like local file paths or user names can be printed into error messages. Be sure to keep these out of content that you post to forums!
:::

Another important aspect in working with this software is file management. Decide before you start a project what your file management strategy will be, and where everything will be stored. Generally when you open a dataset in GIS software, you are only creating a pointer to the locally stored files, not copying the data into the project. This means that if a file gets moved mid-project, the software will be unable to access the data, and you'll have to re-add it to the project. Some file formats, like shapefiles, consist of multiple files that must always be kept in the same folder together. **A robust file management approach will save you time and frustration in the long run.**

:::tip
**Tip**

Mac users will need to override a security setting to download QGIS. Once you have installed QGIS, you will need to go to Security and Privacy in System Preferences. There, you will find a message that “1 GDAL Complete.pkg” was unable to be opened. Select “Open Anyway.” You may need to do this for multiple packages depending on the version of QGIS you download. 

If you still have issues opening QGIS after this, Stack Overflow is a great resource for troubleshooting GIS software issues.

## Intro to Spatial Data 

Spatial data is essential for understanding the world around us, as it combines information with specific locations. This type of data is vital because it allows us to see how information changes with location. Without the geographical component, we're left with just a list, not a spatial analysis or map that can guide decisions or provide insights.

Understanding these aspects of spatial data is crucial, especially as we delve into more complex analyses. Whether it's navigating through the components of a shapefile or exploring data in R, having a grasp on these concepts can help tackle the challenges that come with spatial data analysis.

### Spatial Data Types {-}

Spatial data is generally divided into two broad categories: **vector** and **raster** data. Vector data holds "features" using points, lines, or polygons whereas raster data can be satellite imagery or other pixelated surfaces.

![Vector and raster data model in geographic space (Jukil & Al-Hadad, 2017)](images/data-types.pbm){width=70%}

We mainly use vector data for our purpose. For example, a group of clinics can be geocoded and converted to points, whereas zip code boundaries are represented as polygons. Note that spatial data is not just locations and shapes, but also attributes. So points on a map correspond to associated details for each clinic provider, and may also include fields like “name”, “services”, and more. 

For example, a park can be represented as a polygon or a point. Linked with each park, we can have information regarding their names, sizes, types of plants, open hours, and other various features. These attributes can be stored in a data table, along with their spatial inforamtion, in a shapefile, or a spatial file loaded in your R environment.

![](images/data-diagram.png){width=95%}

### More Types of Data {-}

While we focus on tabular spatial data in this introductory module, you may work with multiple types of data in your SDOH project that is linked to place. Another of thinking about this is considering spatial data as primary, secondary, or tertiary. In the following section, we will provide a brief description of each of these types of data.

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Primary Spatial Data**</summary>Primary spatial data refers to the data that you can collect either personally or through a sensor/machine which you or your stakeholders have previously installed. There are several examples of spatial visualizations of SDOH made with primary data. Some researchers have used online interviews or questionnaires to analyze their experiences in their neighborhood. Other researchers have placed sensors to map air quality in cities. The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or smartphones is another way to generate primary data.</br></br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Secondary Spatial Data**</summary>You may encounter challenges when gathering SDOH primary spatial data, as it can be a time-consuming and costly endeavor. As a result, SDOH researchers, mapmakers, and advocates frequently turn to various secondary resources, such as spatial databases and census records, to inform their spatial representations. Typically, these files consist of digital layers that are prepared for seamless incorporation into a GIS or web mapping application. However, you can also work and manipulate non-spatial data in your project. Notable sources for such data include both profit and non-profit databases, government census information, and even digitized or scanned paper maps.</br></br></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Tertiary Spatial Data**</summary>In the realm of SDOH spatial visualizations, there exists a third option–your map(s) may access other maps’ spatial data. Tertiary spatial data are spatial layers that have been previously or currently utilized in other cartographies and are readily accessible for integration into a Geographic Information System (GIS) or web mapping applications. When engaging with stakeholders experienced in health mapping, it's worth inquiring whether they possess any spatial layers that could prove beneficial for your project. </br></br></details>

It is key to emphasize that data can often be tainted by biases and errors. As a result, the methods used to gather, aggregate, or model spatial data can have adverse effects on the quality of our data visualizations. It is of utmost importance to meticulously scrutinize various forms of data, whether they are qualitative (e..g, interviews or questionnaires), quantitative (e.g., databases), or mixed (e.g., surveys). A valuable starting point for data analysis involves assessing metadata within databases or interview questions. Further insights into this subject will be explored in subsequent sections of this toolkit.

In your project, there's no need to limit yourself to just one kind of data. In fact, it's not only possible but often necessary to mix and match different sources and types of spatial data to craft compelling SDOH spatial visualizations.

### Spatial Data Formats {-}

Just like you may store text in an MS Word document or a PDF, there are many different formats used to store vector spatial data. Keep in mind that file extensions are very important -- it is often how people refer to different file formats.

Perhaps the simplest format is a comma-separated value, or **CSV**, file. This is a plain text format for table storage that can be opened and exported from MS Excel, or even just a simple text editor. What can make a CSV a "spatial" data format is the presence of columns that represent coordinate locations for each row in the table. These columns could be latitude, longitude coordinates, or a single column could hold a different coordinate format like Well-Known Text (WKT). A CSV file name will end in `.csv`, though you may also see `.tsv`, for "tab-separated values".

Another common spatial data format is the **shapefile**. A shapefile is actually a suite of multiple files, all with the same name but each with a different extension. There must be three files present at a minimum, `.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, though typically you will have 4-7 files, other common extensions being `.prj`, `.cpg`, etc. These files must always be kept together, so make sure you zip up a shapefile if you are sending it to someone else!

We will also use a format called **GeoJSON**, `.geojson` or sometimes just `.json`, and you may also hear about GeoPackages, `.gpkg`, though we won't be using that format in this module.

|Format|Extension|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|---|---|
|CSV|`.csv`|Human-readable data<br/>Edit in MS Excel or text editor|Inefficient for large datasets|
|Shapefile|`.shp`<br/>`.shx`<br/>`.dbf`<br/>etc.|Robust and performant<br/>Can use any CRS|10-character attribute name limit<br/>Sidecar files can be confusing!|
|GeoJSON|`.geojson`|Human-readable data<br/>Edit in text editor|Inefficient for large datasets|

*Open a Vector Data File in QGIS*

There are multiple ways to add a vector dataset to a QGIS project. First, open QGIS and create a blank document. Next, use one of these methods:
- Navigate to **Layer** > **Add Layer** > **Add Vector Layer**, and then find the `chicagotracts.shp` file in your file system.
- Use the Browser panel to navigate your file system, and drag `chicagotracts.shp` into the map view.
- In your standard file explorer, navigate to the `chicagotracts.shp` file, then drag and drop it directly into your QGIS project.
    - In your file system you will see all shapefile sidecar files, be sure to use the `.shp` file when you drag it into QGIS.

You will now see a new layer in your **Layers** panel. To "style" the layer (change the colors and symbols that are used to represent it), you can either:

- Right-click on the layer and choose **Properties...**, then go to the **Symbology** tab.
- Go to **View** > **Toolbars** and enable the **Layer Styling** toolbar.
    - This toolbar provides direct access to the symbology for the currently selected layer, no need to open the Properties window!

*Add a Basemap in QGIS*

The easiest way to add a basemap to your QGIS project is through the **QuickMapServices** plugin. To install this plugin:

1. Go to **Plugins** > **Install and Manage Plugins...**
2. Search for and select `QuickMapServices`
3. Click **Install**

Once installed, it's best to add the extra "contributed pack" to this plugin, in order to get more basemap options.

1. Go to **Web** > **QuickMapServices** > **Settings...**
2. Go to the **More services** tab, and click **Get contributed pack**

Depending on your version of QGIS you may have different base map options, but all versions should at least have OSM Standard. Select this to add the base map.

**Warning**: Do not use Google or Bing basemaps in published work, it is generally against their terms of service.

**Challenge**: Repeat the same activity using GeoDa, a spatial statistical software.

## Coordinate Reference Systems

The “spatial” part of spatial data is coordinates. For example, you may have a dataset of hospitals: the location of each feature will be represented by a latitude/longitude coordinate pair. If you have a dataset of county boundaries, each corner, or "vertex" of every shape will be represented by a coordinate as well. The fact that spatial data stores coordinates is the only thing that makes it "special."

However, there are many different ways of storing coordinates (not only latitude/longitude as you may assume) which is what brings us to the concept of a “coordinate reference system” (CRS), which is exactly what it sounds like: a reference system for interpreting coordinates.

![](images/crs-image.png){width=95%}

:::tip
**Tip**

*EPSG Codes*
In the 1980s the European Petroleum Survey Group began a registry of coordinate reference systems, and this database is now a standard registry: All common coordinate reference systems have their own EPSG code.
:::

There are two basic categories of coordinate reference systems: **Geographic (GCS)** and **Projected (PCS)**.

A **GCS** is fairly straightforward, because its coordinates are latitude/longitude "decimal degrees" that look like `44.0208693`, `-92.4841652`. There are just a few common geographic coordinate systems, and the only thing that differentiates them is a slightly different mathematical model of the globe, called a "datum". The most common one is **WGS84** (EPSG: 4326), though you may also see **NAD83** (EPSG: 4269), which is slightly more accurate for North America. For our purposes, we don't need to worry much about the difference between these two.

GeoJSON datasets should only store data in WGS84.

If you're not sure what CRS a latitude/longitude coordinate value is in a dataset you pulled from a data portal, there is a good chance it will be EPSG:4326! Once challenge with this CRS is that the distance is in degrees, not miles or kilometers. To use spatial data for distance or geometric calculations, you'll need to transform to a different CRS that that uses different unit of distance...

A **PCS** on other hand is “projected,” meaning that it is not only based on a datum, but on top of that it uses a **map projection**. Map projections are different methods for flattening the globe (or portions of it) so it can be displayed on a 2-dimensional plane (in other words, a map!). When a geospatial dataset is stored in a projected CRS, it doesn’t actually use latitude/longitude coordinates at all–it uses X/Y coordinates based on the flattened plane that the projection defines.

Robust spatial data formats, like Shapefiles and GeoPackages, are able to store data in any CRS, either geographic or projected.

:::tip

**Tip**

*Summary of Geographic vs. Projected CRS*

- A Geographic Coordinate Reference System interprets coordinates as latitude/longitude positions on the globe.
    - Units: degrees
    - Examples: **WGS84** (EPSG: 4326), **NAD83** (EPSG:4269)
- A Projected Coordinate Reference System interprets coordinates as x, y positions within a given map projection.
    - Units: feet or meters (defined by CRS)
    - Examples: **Web Mercator** (EPSG:3857), **NAD83 / UTM Zone 16** (EPSG: 26916), **NAD83 / Illinois East (ftUS)** (EPSG:3435)

**Always use a projected coordinate system if you are making any distance-related calculations on your spatial data.**
:::

#### Why use Projected Coordinate Reference Systems for Spatial Data? {-}

You may be wondering: Why isn’t all spatial data just stored as latitude/longitude coordinates? The short answer is simply “measurement.” In order to perform any geographic calculations--length of roads, area of districts, distance from hospitals, etc.--you will need to use a projected CRS.

This is because every CRS is defined by the units that its coordinates are stored in, meaning that if your CRS uses latitude/longitude coordinates (like WGS84) your units are degrees. However, degrees are terrible for distance measurements because, for example, one degree of longitude along the equator is 69 miles, but around Chicago it’s just 51.

A projected CRS, having flattened the Earth (or a portion of it) represents a grid system that is not based on degrees but on feet or meters. Therefore, the X/Y coordinates that a projected dataset stores are just the number of feet (or meters) away from the origin of the projection (like a Cartesian coordinate system in algebra). With your data in the appropriate projected CRS for your region, you are ready to make meaningful calculations.

:::tip
**Tip**

*Coordinate Reference Systems in QGIS*

QGIS applies coordinate reference systems at two different levels, and it is important to understand the difference between these levels.

- At the **individual layer level**, QGIS says: *What CRS should be used to interpret this particular dataset?*
Generally, a dataset will properly reports its CRS and no action is needed. However, you can right-click on a layer and use **Layer CRS >** to assign a different CRS to it. This does not change the underlying data, just how it is interpreted.
    - If a layer has no CRS assigned to it, a `?` symbol will appear next to its name and QGIS will default to interpreting is through the project-level CRS.
- At the **project level**, QGIS says: *What CRS should be used to display the layers in this project?* By default, QGIS will choose the CRS of the first layer that you add to a project.
    - You can change the project’s CRS in Project > Properties… > CRS, or through the small button in the bottom right that displays the current CRS.

As long as each layer’s CRS is correctly assigned, GIS software will properly align datasets with different coordinate reference systems, and even allow you to display those datasets in a different projection altogether.

**One of the most common problems people have with spatial data is not knowing what CRS to use with their data!**
:::

#### Common Projected Coordinate Reference Systems {-}

One projected CRS you are already used to seeing is a modern adaptation of the Mercator projection, commonly called **Web Mercator** (EPSG:3857). Every interactive web map--Google, Apple, Uber, Lyft, etc.--uses this projection, because it covers the whole world and has a handful of other advantages. However, this projection is not very good for calculations because it greatly magnifies the size of land masses as you approach the north and south pole.

Instead, we need to use a projected CRS that is designed for a smaller region within which our dataset is located. In the US we commonly use a series of projected CRSs called UTM Zones which are based on the NAD83 datum and the Universal Transverse Mercator projection, for example **NAD83 / UTM Zone 16** (EPSG: 26916) covers Chicago. Another common set of CRS definitions in the US is the State Plane series. Chicago sits within the area best covered by **NAD83 / Illinois East (ftUS)** (EPSG:3435). 

To find a CRS, we recommend using **Google** -- seriously! Google "EPSG Illinois ft" if you want to identify a CRS that is appropriate for the Chicago region as an example, and using an appropriate distance metric for further analysis. Doing this, you'll find that EPSG:3435 emerges as a top choice.

*Reproject Data in QGIS*

If you have spatial data that uses a geographic CRS, like a GeoJSON file, then you will need to transform or reproject that data to a projected CRS in order to use it for any distance-related spatial analysis. Try the following in QGIS:

1. Load the `chicagotracts` dataset by dragging and dropping the `chicagotracts.shp` file into a new blank document.
2. Right-click on the layer in the **Layers** panel.
    - Observe: In **Layer CRS**, QGIS has properly chosen EPSG:4326 (WGS84) to interpret this dataset.
    - Note: By clicking **Set to...** or **Set Layer CRS...** you can tell QGIS to use a different CRS for this layer. *No need to do this in this case!*
    - Choose: Click **Export > Save Features As...** to open the data save dialog box.
3. Pick ESRI Shapefile as the output format.
4. Browse to an appropriate folder and name your export `chicagotracts-3435`.
5. Use the CRS dropdown to select `NAD83 / Illinois East (ftUS)`.
    - If this CRS is not in the dropdown, use the Select CRS button to open a more detailed dialog box.
    - Filter for `NAD83 / Illinois East (ftUS)` and find the appropriate CRS in Projected > Universal Transverse Mercator...
6. Leave all other settings as they are, click **Ok** to save the dataset.
    - The new dataset will be in your selected CRS.

## Converting to Spatial Data

A common goal in SDOH research is to work address-level data, known as *points* or *events* (when considering time) in spatial analysis research. This could refer to resources in a community, . Before we can run any analytics on the resource location data, we need to convert resource addresses to spatial data points, which can be then used to calculate access metrics.

Locations, when measured as points, can include things like:

- **Health providers**: Hospitals, Clinics, Pharmacies, Mental health providers, Medication for opioid use disorder providers
- **Area resources**: Grocery stores & Supermarkets, Playgrounds, Daycare centers, Schools, Community centers
- **Area challenges**: Crime, Superfund sites, Pollution-emitting facilities

Points can also represent people, like individual patients residing in an area. Because individual locations for persons is protected health information, we’ll focus on point data as resources in the chapter. However, you can reuse the approach in this workshop to wrangle patient-level data the same way in a secure environment, under the guidance of your friendly IRB ethics board.

Let's start with an example where the spatial coordinate information has already been embedded within the data set as latitude and longitude information.

### CSV to Spatial Data

Comma separated (CSV) files are not a spatial data format. To be used for spatial analysis or mapping they will need to be converted to a spatial data format, such as a `GeoJSON` or `shapefile` data format. As long as a CSV contains spatial data like coordinates, GIS software should allow you to save CSV data as a new spatial data file. 

There are multiple options for converting CSV files to spatial data. For this type of conversion, you’ll want a CSV file with coordinate information (e.g. longitude and latitude) in separate fields. It's possible that coordinates recorded using a different CRS that is not long/lat, though we'll use a classical example here.

Your CSV may have:

- One field for **longitude** (which will be read as the **x** coordinate)
- One field for **latitude** ( which will be read as the **y** coordinate)

Using a GIS or coding platform, you'll assign the coordinate values and indicate the CRS being used. If you're not sure what the CRS is and it's a long/lat value, try EPSG:4326 as the most commont. You made need to troubleshoot if this is not the correct CRS for your dataset by inspecting documentation for the data. 

Always open a CSV to inspect it before trying to convert it. Verify longitude and latitude are in separate fields, and those fields are correctly labeled. Then, inspect afterwards! Make sure the points are plotting where you expect them. Common errors during this step is mixing up the long/lat, or assigning the wrong CRS.

### Geocode Addresses

What if your original dataset only has addresses? In that case, you'll need to geocode your data to identify coordinates for spatial data transformation.

Addresses are not spatial data. They are real-world representations of spatial data, but GIS software will not be able to map them without further information. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates using a known coordinate reference system (CRS). We can then use these coordinates (ex. longitude, latitude) to spatially enable data. 

#### Using Topologies {-}

Geocoding services use [topologies](https://www.opengeomatics.ca/topology-and-geocoding.html#geocoding) to assign street addresses along streets. Different services have differing degrees of topology quality; some are updated regularly, and others may have fewer updates, so precision may not be the same. Many services will give you a match score to let you know how closely the address matched their information. 

How precise does your measure need to be? Do you want to reject matches with <90% uncertainty? Some services will not have this option available. If you're at a university or institutional setting, you may have access to geocoding services with more precise topologies, like ESRI or Google proprietary geocoding products. The examples used in this textbook use an open topology that will provide reasonable accuracy for many areas. 

:::tip
**Tip**

If you are geocoding [protected health information (PHI)](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/hipaa/hipaa18.html), you may not use web-based geocoding service. Check with your instution to access a server-based, offline, HIPPA-compliant geocoding service.  
:::

#### Data Preparation for Geocoding {-}

After determining the geocoding service you'll use, plan for an intensive data cleaning and preparation stage. Read the service documentatioon to understand how data must be formatted. You will likely need to split your address field as different address, city, state, and zip code values. 

Geocoding tools may be having an issue reading some addresses due to formatting issues in the CSV. Suite or apartment numbers, for example, may cause tools to be unable to geocode addresses. Only include the street address in the address column of your CSV. If you want to retain apartment or suite numbers, include them in a separate column in your CSV. Another common issue is an address being miswritten in your CSV file. 

Even something as small as an extra apostrophe can prevent an address from being geocoded properly. Many cities have also addresses that are duplicates or are very similar. Providing  the most information you can is the best way to resolve this issue. Geocoding tools can use street address, city, state, and country information to geocode addresses. If you do not already have all of this information in your original CSV, add it and try geocoding again.

## Merge data sets

Merging data sets is a vital skill for analyzing health data from an SDOH perspective. SDOH data and health data will often be in separate data sets, but use the same geographic scale, such as zip code or census tract. Being able to merge these kinds of data sets together using that scale is important to the ease of performing analysis with your data.

You will likely be merging data in flat files, like statistical datasets and Census records, to a spatial boundary corresponding to some administrative boundary. The new spatial dataset, a shapefile or GeoJson, is your master dataset that retains all of the original data, spatial boundaries, and new data you're merging in. 

Place literally serves as your "key" to join the data together.

### Reshape Data {-} 

Data sets often don’t come in GIS-friendly formats. Flat files may be separated vertically among multiple variables (long format) rather than horizontally along a single identifying variable (wide format). While long format is considered a standard for "tidy" data and the standard in epidemiological research, it's not efficient for GIS purposes. To merge data to boundaries for mapping and some spatial analysis, we'll have to reshape from long to wide format. Knowing how to reshape data efficiently will make you a master data wrangler.

![](images/04-pivot.png)

You can use pivot tables in Excel to reshape your data, or your favorite coding approach. Reshaping data is a pain, but important for subsequent research! 

:::activity

**Activity**

*Long to Wide with Excel*

**File:** `COVID-19_Cases__Tests__and_Deaths_by_ZIP_Code.csv` 

To create a wide data set with the cumulative cases for each week for each zip code, create a pivot table in Excel. 

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 1: Create a Pivot Table**</summary>

- Open the CSV as an excel file, and open a new sheet. 
- Go to Insert -> Pivot Table. 
- Select the data you wish to include; in this case, we want the cumulative case data, so select columns A-F from the original excel sheet. 
- Make sure the pivot table will be placed in the new excel sheet, and hit OK. 

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 2: Add Your Data**</summary>

The pivot table will open with the selected data, which can be sorted into rows, columns, values, and filters. 
- In this example, the zip codes should be our rows, so choose Zip Code from the selection and drag it into Rows. 
- We want our columns to be organized by week, so drag either Week Number, Week Start, or Week End into the Columns. 
- You’ll notice these variables split into multiple categories when dragged into a pivot table field. Use the information icon at the side of each category unwanted information. 
- Finally, drag Cases - Cumulative into the Values to fill out the table.

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 3: Clean Up Your Table**</summary>

Pivot tables often generate columns and rows that are unnecessary for our purposes. These extra columns and rows could make it difficult for spatial software to read your CSV later.

- Use the drop down menu for Row Labels or Column Labels to remove any unwanted rows or columns, such as Grand totals and the first row that includes Sum of Cases and Column Labels.  
- Rename the column containing zip codes. 

<br/></details>

Your nearly completed pivot table will look something like this:

![pivotresult](images/04-8pivotresult.png)

Update the column names to include the variable and date together for bonus points (ex. "Cases_050320"). Note that if you will later merge to a shapefile, you'll need to stick under 10 characters for variable names.

Save the sheet as a new CSV by going to File -> Save As. It's ready for merging!

**Note**: You can also select variables of interest as a subset of the data using QGIS or GeoDa.

[*Reshaping Data in R*](https://toolkit.sdohplace.org//04-dataR.html#reshape-data-1)
:::


### Join by Attribute {-}

One of the most common spatial data tasks is merging. First, we merge by attribute, meaning the "key" to join two datasets exists as an exising column name. That may be a zip code, neighborhood, or county ID. For this step, you want to ensure you have a 1:1 match, meaning that your flat file data includes data for each geographic area only once. If not, go back to the "reshape data" section, rinse, and repeat!


#### Geographic Identifiers {-}

You will come across data with various different boundaries, such as county, zip code, and census tracts. Each of these boundaries have a unique identification code. In the U.S., that could be a  Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) code, or numbers which uniquely identify geographic areas. These are types of **Geographic Identifiers**, also known as GEOID's for short. 

Some of the most common administrative/legal and statistical geographic entities with unique GEOIDs include states, counties, congressional districts, core based statistical areas (metropolitan and micropolitan areas), census tracts, block groups and census blocks. Sometimes a census tract may be identified by its full 11-digit FIPS code, and other times, the data provider may only include the last 6 digits.  Learn more about [GEOIDs at the U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) for tips. Some cities, like New York and Chicago, have developed additional neighborhood boundaries that aggregate census tracts. 


#### Merging to Spatial Data {-}

To merge your data to a geographic area, you'll need to find the geographic spatial boundary or corresponding spatial data. You can search the Census for the specific area of interest, and select your year vintage (ex. "Illinois tracts in 2010"). You could also search using carefully selected keywords in your town's Data Portal (ex. "Chicago tract boundaries"), or using Google as a search engine (ex. "Milwaukee census tract .shp"). Note that tract boundaries changed in 2020 (and generally every decade), so learning how to work with a Census crosswalk may take more time and learning in your journey.

After inspecting your spatial dataset, ensure you know the GEOID of the variable that will be your key. Inspect the dataset you are joining, and identify the corresponding key. We recommend joining to the spatial dataset, not the other way around, to preserve data quality. Inspect any rows that were lost after joining during merges.

*Merge SDOH data to Zip Codes in GeoDa*

Here, we’ll merge data sets with a common variable using GeoDa. Merging the cumulative case data set you created in the last section to zip code spatial data will allow you to map the case data. You’ll be merging the case data and spatial data using the zip codes field of each dataset. 

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 1: Clean Zip Code Data**</summary>

We've cleaned our covid case data already, but you’ll notice that the zip codes are repeated in the zip code data set, and needs to be cleaned before we can continue with merging the data. 

- Select one row for each zip code and save the selection as a new geojson, ChiZipCleaned. 

You’ll notice that two zip codes have repeats that are not exactly alike. This is because these two zip codes have small exclaves, and so are listed separately since they are separate polygons. However, having the repeated zip code will create problems when merging the data, and the exclaves are small enough not to be relevant for our analysis. Only choose the rows with a larger area for these two zip codes.

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 2: Merge Data**</summary>

- Open ChiZipCleaned.geojson. 
- Go to Table -> Merge. 
- Select the cumulative case data set. 
- Under parameters, select Merge by key values, with zip selected for current table key and Zip Code selected for import table key. 
- Move over all data columns you want to see in this merged data set.

Tip: you do not need to include Zip Code since this field is being used to merge the two data sets, including it will only duplicate zip codes in the resulting data set.

*Using Zip Codes* 

Zip codes are often the smallest area resolution available for many health researchers, due to privacy concerns. However, zip codes correspond to postal service routes, are not meaningful administrqtive units, and can mask data insights at the neighborhood level as a result. Associations that may appear if using tract-level data could be hidden at the zip code level. Be careful, and understand your limitations!

The Census provides Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), which are similar to but not exactly the 5-digit Zip Codes people think of when referencing their postal address. Furthermore, full 9-digit Zip Codes change regularly. For precision, consider using the [HUD Crosswalk](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html) to transform your zip code year to a census tract. 
:::



### Join by Location {-}

Sometimes, you won't have a boundary key! How will you know which parks fall into which census tract? Or what about selecting neighborhoods with commuter train infrastructure?

A spatial join is defined as merging data based on location. Both datasets are spatially enabled, and likely overlap each other. The data from one dataset (that you're joining) gets "stuck" to the dataset you're merging to. Both data should be in the same CRS.

Add spatial joins to data to analyze the relationships data sets may have with each other. This tool allows you to merge certain aspects of data sets, such as joining descriptive statistics about one data sets relation to the other.

:::activity
**Activity**

*Add a Spatial Join*

We’ll create a spatial join with affordable housing development data and ChiZipCleaned.geojson. In this case, we’ll add the number of affordable housing developments in each zip code to the zip code data set.

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 1: Join Attributes**</summary>

Go to Processing -> Toolbox and search for Join Attributes. For this exercise, select Join attributes by location (summary). Set the following parameters:

![joinparameters](images/04-13joinparameters.png)

These parameters are set on the premise that we want a count of the affordable housing developments contained within each zip code. A new joined layer will be mapped on top of your current layers. 

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Step 2: Map the Joined Data**</summary>

The new layer generated by the spatial join will default to a single symbol map, not providing any useful visual information about the spatial join.

- Change the symbology by right clicking and going to Properties -> Symbology.
- Change the symbology from Single Symbol to Graduated with the value Community Area Name_count. 

Try changing the color ramp, mode, and number of classes. The resulting joined layer may look similar to the one below.

![joinmap](images/04-14joinmap.png)

*Note: In order for null values to appear, you may need to first set symbology to graduated colors, then change it to Rule-based. Add a field with the rule set to Else rather than Filter. Then change colors and arrange as you wish.*

**Pitfall**

*Invalid Geometries*

In the example above, Zip code 60655 has an enclave not included in the Chicago city limits, and you may have a technical issue with that enclave when moving between GeoDa and QGIS with the newly cleaned Chicago zip code data that causes an Invalid Geometry error when conducting a spatial join. Since the zip code in question has no affiliated affordable housing developments, in this case we’ll set the Invalid feature filter, found under the layer’s Advanced Options when creating the spatial join, to skip features with invalid geometries.
:::

## Inspect Data 

Inspect data, both through spatial and non-spatial means, when starting a new project, after each step of data processing, and when complete. That means all the time! This helps verify that all data wrangling to this point has occurred properly. 

In the next module, we'll dive into the details of this further, moving past inspection to cartography anddata analytics.

### Thematic Maps {-}

To inspect data from a spatial perspective, create a series of choropleth maps. A choropleth map is a thematic map that utilizes shades, textures, and colors to depict data values in specific geographic areas. Choropleth maps are useful for rapidly discerning spatial data patterns. However, these patterns may vary depending on the chosen data classification method.

### Map Overlay {-}

Overlay multiple data sets to investigate how they correspond to one another. Open the data sets you are interested in and order your layers appropriately to get an initial view of potential relationships between data sets.

:::activity
**Inspect Data with Different Methods**

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Generate Choropleth Maps in GeoDa**</summary>

Open ChiZipCleaned.geojson. From the Map option on the toolbar, you can select a variety of choropleth map options using different variables or breaks for your data. 

Select a mapping method and a variable to map. Inspect your data by comparing how different data break methods present the same variables, and how the spatial patterns of different variables compare. 

![choroplethmaps](images/04-10choroplethmaps.png)

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Overlay Data in GeoDa**</summary>

With the Chicago zip code data already loaded in GeoDa, add a layer of point data with Affordable_Rental_Housing_Developments.csv. 

- From the map view, select Add Map Layer. 
- Select the affordable housing data set, set the lat/long fields, and hit OK. 
- If you do not see the housing data, go to Map Layer Settings. Make sure the layer is turned on and ordered first.

Once you add it to one map, you should be able to find it as a layer in each subsequent map you make with these data sets for the duration of your mapping session.

Note: the first row does not have lat/long data and may impede GeoDa from mapping the rest of the affordable housing data set. If you have this problem, try removing this row from the CSV.

![geodaoverlay](images/04-11overlaymap.png)

<br/></details>

<details markdown='1'><summary>**Overlay Data in QGIS**</summary>

Let’s overlay zip code boundary data with affordable housing point data.

- Load ChiZipCleaned.geojson into QGIS. 
- Add Affordable_Rental_Housing _Development.csv by going to Layer -> Add Layer-> Delimited Text Layer.
- Navigate to the file, and ensure all fields indicate the correct data source in order to display the data properly.

![qgisoverlay](images/04-12qgisoverlay.png)

Adjust the color, transparency, size, and borders of each layer by right clicking the layer and going to Styles -> Edit Symbol. The affordable housing data can also be saved as a spatial data set at this point, by right clicking on the layer and navigating to Save Features As.

## Finding Data

In this module, we provided sample data to work with. When you're looking for your own data to integrate, you'll need to do some research to find what you need. Here are some tips of places to search:

- City, County, and State Data Portals. Look for your area of interest using search terms like "tracts" or "zip code" to find aggregate data ready for joining.

- The Social Vulnerability Index dataset by CDC includes cleaned American Community Survey that is easy to extract and merge with your spatial data.

- While U.S. Census data is available at Census.gov, finding data may be more efficient using third party platforms like IPUMS/NHGIS or Social Explorer. We also recommend the tidycensus package in R (see Appendix Resources for details).

- Additional aggregated products to check out include: EJScreen, the City Health Dashboard, County Health Rankings, the Opportunity Atlas, the Neighborhood Atlas, and more.

- Learning how to use the "turbo-pass" Open Street Map plugin in QGIS, or R corresponding library, will give you access to a public version of digitized infrastructure (e.g. streets, parks) and resources (e.g. supermarkets, schools) across the globe. Some areas have better coverage than others.

When determining which data to include, consider using a conceptual model to guide your variable selection. The socio-ecological model of health or risk environment models, for example, identify specific indicators that you may want to fold in.

**Potential Pitfall**

The **Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)** is a significant issue in spatial analysis that arises when results of statistical analysis are affected by the scale or the zoning of the area units used in the study. Essentially, it reflects the idea that the same set of data can lead to different conclusions depending on how the data is grouped geographically. 

This problem is particularly relevant in disciplines like geography, epidemiology, and urban planning. For a deeper understanding of MAUP, its implications, and strategies to mitigate its effects, [here's a comprehensive resource](https://gisgeography.com/maup-modifiable-areal-unit-problem/) that offers detailed insights.

:::

## Defining your Position

In exploring cartography and spatial analysis, it's crucial to challenge their perceived objectivity. Traditionally viewed as neutral tools, unaffected by the biases of their creators, recent studies, especially from feminist and global South perspectives, have started to challenge this view. They reveal how data often overlooks marginalized communities, how maps can perpetuate colonialist views, and how the choice of colors and symbols might oversimplify diverse human experiences.

Therefore, it's essential to rethink our approach to maps and analyses, recognizing that they are not impartial mirrors of reality. When conducting analyses or creating maps, we should ask ourselves critical questions: Who is collecting the data I use, and for what purpose? Which narratives are my analyses emphasizing? Whose interests does the software I use serve – is it a commercial product or open-source? How do factors like our gender, race, ethnicity, economic status, sexuality, and nationality influence our approach to cartography?

A way forward involves examining our privileges, recognizing the types of discrimination we face—or don’t face—and considering how our experiences influence our mapping efforts. Listening becomes a crucial skill. Mapping should go beyond mere argumentation and become a tool for inquiry. We must critically examine our own maps and data, paying attention to who is represented and, importantly, who is left out. Engaging with stakeholders is a key part of this process.

Additionally, we should strive to give a voice within our analyses to those directly impacted by our maps rather than speaking for them. Being mindful of our cartographic language is vital; like words, maps convey narratives.

::: tip

**Tip**

Take time to reflect on these points and jot them down in your journal. Regularly revisit these thoughts and refer back to Module 1 of this toolkit, recognizing that mapping is an evolving, iterative process.
:::

### Reflective Mapping

Remember, mapping is more than just inputting data into software; it involves thoughtful reflection. This process should take into consideration the context and significance of the data, ensuring that your maps tell an accurate and meaningful story. By carefully selecting and analyzing your variables, and critically examining the resulting spatial patterns, your maps can become powerful tools for understanding and communicating complex social and health-related phenomena.

In modern spatial epidemiology, it’s critical to not take associations at face value. For instance, health disparities are often driven not by race itself but by systemic racism. Analyzing only a specific racial or ethnic group isn’t sufficient. Thus, investigating a multitude of variables and cultivating a curiosity to understand these complex intersections is crucial for meaningful knowledge discovery. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between various factors and health outcomes, ultimately contributing to more effective public health strategies and interventions.


## Calculating Spatial Variables

While the previous module focused on spatial data wrangling techniques to develop new harmonized datasets and variables, there are many more approaches to refining measurements of the environment. 

For example, spatial access to a resource can be calculated using multiple approaches. Let's consider approximating a neighborhood as a census tract. Access to the resource could be measured as:

- Total number of resources within the census tract
- Total number of resources within a mile of the census tract
- Total number of mile-wide resource buffers intersecting the tract
- Percentage of the census tract covered by a mile-wide resource buffer
- Drive, bike, or walk time from the center of tract to nearest resource
- Total number of resources within a mile per 1,000 people in the census tract
- Gravity model score measuring spatial access to resoure using a distance decay function, total capacity at resource, and population in demand

Which one is best? It will depend the data available, your skills and interest in calculations, and more importantly, the underlying phenomenon of interest. How often do persons access the resource? What travel behavior is used? 

For density based measures (like total number of resources per area), use the spatial join function froom the last module, and summarize by area. This is also termed as a "point in polygon" operation. For additional proximity-based metrics like buffer and distance calculations, read on. For more complex access modeling techniques, check out the advanced metric resources at the end of the module.

### Buffers

Creating buffers and calculating distances are vital techniques for understanding relationships between geographic features and identifying potential spatial patterns or associations.

Buffers are polygons created at a specified distance around input features, like points, lines, or other polygons. They are useful for analyzing the proximity of health-related phenomena to specific locations.

*(E.g., Census tracts within ½ mile radius of a public health clinic) *

For example, you can create a buffer of a half-mile radius around a public health clinic to analyze the census tracts within that area. Another application is generating a buffer around a hospital to identify the population within a certain distance or assessing the impact of pollution from a factory on nearby schools or residential areas.

To create a buffer in GIS software or coding, you specify a fixed or variable distance value. Fixed-distance buffers are constant radius polygons around input features, while variable-distance buffers can vary based on an attribute value.

Buffer Analyses: Calculate Farmers Market Service Areas

This activity focuses on utilizing data from Chicago's farmers' markets, specifically the "farmers_markets_2012" dataset. Farmers' markets are vital for health and well-being, providing access to fresh, locally-grown produce and supporting sustainable food systems. They offer diverse, nutritious food options, often at affordable prices, and foster community connections and local agriculture support. The presence and density of farmers' markets in a neighborhood significantly influence residents' food accessibility.

Start a New Project:
Open QGIS and create a new project. Save it as “Chicago Farmers Markets 2012”.
Add the Dataset:
Add the shapefile: "farmers_markets_2012.shp".
Creating Buffers:
Go to the Vector menu > Geoprocessing Tools > Buffer(s).
In the dialog box, choose "farmers_markets_2012" as the input layer.
Ensure you are using the correct Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
Enter the buffer distance (e.g., 0.5 miles) and select the appropriate unit from the Unit drop-down menu.
Tip: The distance unit is based on the CRS of the input layer. If you're not using the correct CRS, the default unit may be in degrees. Refer to Module 4 if you encounter issues.
Keep default settings for segments, join style, and miter limit.
Initially, leave the "dissolve result" box unchecked to maintain separate buffer zones.

** Running the Buffer Tool:** 
Click "Run" to execute the Buffer tool. A new buffered layer is added to your project.
In the Layers Panel, arrange the point feature (farmers markets) above the buffered polygon for better visualization.
Tip: Observe how the buffers overlap or remain separate, depending on the distance you chose.

** Dissolving Overlapping Areas:** 
Reopen the Buffer dialog box, go to Parameters, and check the box for "dissolve result".
Click "Run" again. A new layer with dissolved overlapping areas is added.
Close the Buffer dialog box.
Organizing Your Layers:
Remove the initial overlapping buffer layer and keep the dissolved buffer layer.

** Tip:**  Organize your layers for clarity, such as renaming layers, removing unwanted ones, or toggling layer visibility.

Through this activity, you will understand the spatial distribution of farmers' markets in Chicago and their impact radius, which is crucial for assessing community access to fresh food. The buffer analysis illustrates the physical reach of these markets, offering insights into potential areas needing more access to fresh produce.

::: 

### Nearest Resource
Calculating distances involves measuring straight-line (Euclidean) or network (along paths or roads) distances between features.In health geographies, this might include assessing accessibility to healthcare facilities or analyzing the spatial distribution of disease cases relative to risk factors. Examples include calculating the Euclidean distance from residential locations to the nearest healthcare facility or measuring the network distance along roads to determine travel time to hospitals. 

It’s important to choose the right measurement method (Euclidean or network) based on the research question and the nature of the features.

::: activity
** Activity ** 

Minimum Distance Calculations 

In this part of the exercise, we're interested in determining the straight-line distance from residential locations, such as census tracts, to the nearest farmers market. The "Distance to nearest hub (line to hub)" tool in QGIS can be used to calculate the distance between the center of an origin feature (e.g., centroids of Census Tracts) and its nearest destination feature (e.g., farmers market).

** Accessing the Tool:** 
In QGIS, open the Toolbox by going to Processing.
Search for and select "Distance to Nearest Hub (line to hub)" under Vector analysis.


** Setting Up the Tool:** 
In the processing dialog box, set "Source Point layer" to "Chicgotracts_Centroids".
For "Destination hubs layer", select "farmer’s market_2012".
Choose your preferred measurement unit (e.g., miles) in the "Measurement unit" field.
Leave other settings as default.
Running the Tool:
Click "Run". A new layer ("hub distance") will be added to your project. Close the dialogue box.
Open the attribute table of the new layer to view the computed hub distances (HubDist).

** Analyzing Access to Facilities:** 
Examine the attribute table to identify if there are any facilities (e.g., farmers markets) that lack good access. Consider the implications of these findings for community access to fresh produce.
Using Extract within Distance Tool:
Another useful tool is the "Extract within distance" under vector selection in the geoprocessing toolbox.
This can be used to extract tract centroids that are within a specified maximum distance (e.g., 1 mile) from the input features (e.g., farmers markets).

Through these exercises, you will gain insights into the accessibility of fresh produce from various residential areas in Chicago, which is crucial for understanding the availability of healthy food options across the city. This analysis can inform urban planning and policy decisions to improve access to essential amenities like farmers markets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Univariate and Bivariate Analyses

#### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are invaluable for visualizing relationships between SDOH and health outcomes. They plot data points on a Cartesian plane, with one variable on the x-axis and another on the y-axis.

In SDOH analysis, scatter plots can uncover possible correlations (both positive and negative) or patterns between socioeconomic factors and health indicators.

Understanding Correlations in Scatter Plots:

- Positive Correlation: This is observed when data points in a scatter plot align along an upward diagonal line. It suggests that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well.

- Negative Correlation: Seen when data points align along a downward diagonal line, indicating that one variable decreases as the other increases.

Interpreting these correlations offers insights into potential links between SDOH factors and health outcomes, guiding targeted interventions and policy-making.

However, it's important to remember that correlation does not equate to causation. Always complement scatter plot analyses with additional analysis, theories, and concepts to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the data and its implications.

::: activity
Creating Scatter Plots in GeoDa

Scatter plots in GeoDa are useful for examining linear relationships between two variables:

Setting Up the Scatter Plot:
To start, select "Explore" > "Scatter Plot".
In the "Scatter Plot Variables" dialog, choose a variable for the "Independent Var X" (e.g., age Over 65) and another for the "Dependent Var Y" (e.g., disability status).
In this example, we're exploring the relationship between the population over 65 years and disability status. It’s generally good practice to place the variable you’re most interested in as the Y (dependent) variable.
Customizing and Analyzing the Scatter Plot:
Once the scatter plot is generated, you can right-click on it to access various functions, such as changing the color or saving the image.
Examine the plot to assess the relationship between the two variables. Look for patterns such as a positive or negative correlation, or no apparent correlation.


Both the cartogram and scatter plot are powerful tools in GeoDa, allowing for visual exploration of data. The cartogram provides a unique perspective by resizing geographic areas based on the data, while scatter plots help identify and analyze relationships between variables, offering crucial insights for data-driven decision-making and research.

Having addressed the subjectivity of maps, let's delve into choropleth maps, a key tool in the exploratory spatial analysis of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). Choropleth maps are instrumental in examining health geographies and SDOH, using different shades or colors to depict varying values or rates of specific variables across geographic areas, such as counties, census tracts, or ZIP codes.

** image

Choropleth maps can help us to start revealing spatial patterns and disparities in various health and socioeconomic indicators related to SDOH. These representations can pinpoint areas with high rates of chronic diseases, like diabetes or heart disease, and enable visual comparisons with factors like education, access to healthcare facilities, and social exclusion.

Moreover, choropleth maps are excellent for exploring potential correlations between SDOH and health outcomes. They can, for example, show how regions with limited access to healthy food options and green spaces might correlate with higher obesity rates. This visual data can inform targeted interventions and resource allocation, addressing social determinants in specific areas effectively.

Choropleth maps are also invaluable in communicating complex data to policymakers, public health officials, and community members. By visually representing intricate datasets in an accessible format, these maps can spark discussions around health disparities, resource distribution, and health equity. Given their capability to illustrate spatial patterns and the relationship between SDOH and health outcomes, choropleth maps are a vital resource for researchers, policymakers, and community organizations aiming to promote health equity and tackle the root causes of health disparities.

::: activity

**Activity** 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, choropleth maps became crucial for health geographers, visually representing the virus's spread and highlighting hotspots and regional disparities. These maps, tracking trends over time, provided a deeper understanding of the pandemic's progression, supporting targeted interventions and policy-making. They not only made the pandemic's impact tangible but also emphasized the significance of spatial analysis in public health crises and showcased the practicality of geographic data visualization in research and decision-making contexts.

Now, let's create some maps to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic. We'll use QGIS for this tutorial, chosen for its flexibility in creating choropleth maps and its status as free, open-source software. 

Note: Other software options like R (see appendix) and GeoDa are also suitable for this task. Additionally, ArcGIS Pro and Carto are viable options, but remember they are proprietary and require a fee.

Opening a New Project in QGIS:
Start by opening a new project in QGIS.
In the Layers panel, drag and drop the "COVID-19_pivot.xlsx" spreadsheet, as outlined in section 4.5 of this toolkit. If you don't have it, find it in the Zip folder at the start of this module.
Joining your spreadsheet with a boundary shapefile:
Similar to the process in Module 4, join the "COVID-19_pivot.xlsx" with the boundary shapefile of Chicago's Zip codes, named “Chicago_Zipcodes.shp”.
Add “Chicago_Zipcodes.shp” to your layer panel.
 To access the join option, right click on “Chicago_Zipcodes.shp”, go to properties and select “join”. Lastly, select the “ plus icon.” 
Similar to GeoDa, you will need to specify: “the spreadsheet or layer you want to join” (e.g., COVID-19_pivot.xlsx), and the join and target fields (e.g., “zip”). Then click Okay.
Check the attribute table on “Chicago_Zipcodes.shp.” You will see the fields from "COVID-19_pivot.xlsx" are there!
Lastly, right click on “Chicago_Zipcodes.shp.” Select “Duplicate layer.” Right-click the new layer, Select “rename, and name it  “Chicago_COVID-19”.
Tip: If you need to review and better understand this step, go back to Module 4.  

Applying Symbology:
In the Layers panel, right-click on “Chicago_COVID-19” and select Properties, then Symbology.
Change the top tab from Single Symbol to Graduated.
Under the "Value" tab, select "Sum of Cases - Weekly".
Set the Mode to “Natural Breaks (Jenks)” and Classes to “4”.
Click Classify, Apply, and Ok. You've now created a map of the Sum of Cases of COVID-19 during a week in 2020 in Chicago.

Exploring Different Classification Methods:
From the Map option in the toolbar, explore different choropleth map options using various variables or data breaks (e.g., quantile).
Select a classification method, set the Categories (e.g., 4), and click apply.
Examine your maps, comparing how different data break methods display the same variables and how spatial patterns vary between different variables.
Mapping Multiple Variables Simultaneously:
To investigate multiple maps at once, use the GeoJason file “ChiZipCleaned” that you organized in Module 4.
Create different choropleth maps using various variables from the attribute table. For example, map the percentages of Asian (asianP), Black (blackP), Hispanic/Latinx (HispP), White (WhiteP), and populations over 65 (Over65p). Use Natural Breaks and 4 classes, similar to your previous COVID-19 map.

From the exploratory results, where darker colors indicate higher population density and gray signifies data absence, we observe that cumulative COVID-19 outcomes for one week in September 2020 seem to correlate geographically with the Latinx/Hispanic community in Chicago.

To refine your analysis further, consider introducing additional variables. Options might include the percentage of essential workers, varying age groups, or internet access. Integrating health outcomes such as asthma or hypertension rates at a similar scale could also offer deeper insights.
:::

#### Cartograms 

Cartograms in Analyzing SDOH Data:

Cartograms offer a distinctive way to analyze and display Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data. They differ from traditional choropleth maps by altering the size of geographic areas based on a statistical variable like population.

This technique provides a clearer depiction of disparities in SDOH across regions, highlighting areas more significantly impacted by adverse social and economic conditions.

Although cartograms can distort geographic shapes and boundaries, they effectively communicate complex SDOH data, helping policymakers and the public understand underlying inequities and the necessity for focused interventions.

Cartograms in GeoDa

To create a cartogram in GeoDa, which visually emphasizes specific variables, follow these steps:

Creating the Cartogram
      
Open ChiZipCleaned in “GeoDa”
b.  Select "Map" from the menu, then click on "Cartogram".

c .In the "Cartogram Variables" dialog box, you'll find two columns: "Circle Size" and "Circle Color". For a simpler interpretation, select the same variable for both columns (e.g., age 18-64). 
d. Tip: While you can choose different variables for circle size and color, this might make the cartogram more complex and potentially confusing.
Finalizing the Cartogram:
Click "OK" to generate the cartogram. This will create a map where the size of the circles represents the selected variable, providing a visual emphasis on areas with higher or lower values.

### Multivariate Data Analysis


## Cartographic Principles 

Having honed your skills in data wrangling and spatial analysis, it's time to focus on effectively communicating your findings in Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) through cartography. This phase is vital: the choices you make regarding colors, scales, and legends will significantly influence how your audience interprets your maps. In this final section, we'll discuss how to create clear and impactful SDOH maps.

Cartographic design principles form a framework of guidelines and best practices to create informative and visually appealing maps. They are key to ensuring maps not only convey spatial information accurately but are also easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing. While designing SDOH maps poses challenges, it's a crucial skill. We encourage you to delve deeper into cartographic design by exploring additional resources provided in this module.

**Tip** 

As recommended by [Cynthia Brewer](https://www.esri.com/en-us/esri-press/browse/designing-better-maps-a-guide-for-gis-users) attempt to address the following questions at this point. Don't worry if you're uncertain of the answer, you can always revisit the previous modules for guidance.

- Who will be reading your maps? (module 3)
- What information will be mapped? (module 4)
- What are the time and budget constraints on your map production? (module 2)
- Will your map be coordinated with written text, videos, graphics, or other data visualizations? Do you have time to create or curate them? (module 2)

Tailor your map design to your audience's needs and preferences. Different audiences have varying abilities to interpret visual data. For instance, maps for healthcare professionals might include detailed spatial patterns and statistical analyses, whereas maps for the general public should focus on clarity and ease of understanding.
Revisit your user personas (module 3) and consider their motivations and challenges regarding cartography.
For example, The City of Chicago (see below) created a COVID-19 vaccine centers asset map for the general public.

ESRI (see below) created a dashboard for health professionals related to vaccine distribution during the pandemic. 

#### Visual Hierarchy {-}

Establish a visual hierarchy to guide viewers through the most important aspects of your data. This can be achieved using color, size, contrast, and the placement of map elements.
For example, ChiVes, an environmental justice dashboard may use bold colors to highlight critical areas, supported by descriptive text and a well-positioned legend.

#### Balance and Visual Arrangement {-}

Achieve balance in your map to ensure no element dominates excessively and each component is visually proportionate.
Organize elements logically and harmoniously, considering spatial relationships, grouping related features, and creating a clear flow for the viewer's eye.

The body-territory map (cuerpo-territorio) crafted by the Latinx collective Iconoclasistas serves as an exemplary showcase of balance and visual arrangement. Illustrating the detrimental impact of various industries on communities across South America, the map achieves balance by symmetrically delineating different regions and dividing them with the silhouette of a woman. Moreover, the title and sequential numbering naturally guides viewers through the map from top to bottom, facilitating intuitive reading of the cartography.

#### Simplicity {-}
Embrace simplicity for clear communication. Clear, uncluttered maps with essential elements are more accessible and easier for viewers to understand.
Focus on presenting the core message with precise use of color, symbols, and labeling.

The Anti-eviction Mapping Project developed a straightforward yet impactful dashboard illustrating evictions in LA County during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can easily navigate through the data by utilizing the bar chart. By using the bar chart, the map displays eviction rates for each month throughout the pandemic.

Throughout these principles, the key is to present your SDOH data in a manner that is not just informative but also engaging and accessible to your intended audience. Each design decision, from the choice of color scheme to the positioning of elements, plays a role in how effectively your map communicates its message.


### Key Elements of Data Viz {-}

Effectively conveying spatial information in maps requires careful consideration of various elements. These elements include symbols, colors, typography, and layout, each playing a crucial role in guiding the viewer’s understanding of the geographic context and the presented data. Symbols visually represent spatial features; colors differentiate categories or highlight patterns; typography ensures legibility and informativeness of labels and annotations; and layout determines spatial relationships and influences visual hierarchy. Strategic incorporation of these elements enables cartographers to create maps that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also informative and intuitive to interpret.

#### Title {-}
A map’s title should succinctly convey its main theme or message. It should include the theme (What?), the location (Where?), and the temporal scale (When?). A clear and informative title sets the context for the map.

**Tip:** Make the title larger and bolder than other text to draw attention.

#### Legend {-}
The legend is a key component that decodes the symbols, colors, and patterns used on your map. It should be clear, concise, and understandable.

**Tip:** Place the legend near the map body and maintain a consistent color scheme and symbol style throughout your map series for coherence.

#### Scale Bar {-}
The scale bar visually represents the relationship between map distances and real-world distances. It's essential for accurately grasping the mapped area's geographic extent and proportions.

**Tip:** Choose a scale bar style that complements your map's design, including both metric and imperial units if possible.

#### Data Source and Projection Information  {-}

Providing data sources and projection information enhances your map's transparency and credibility, allowing viewers to understand the data’s origins and any potential map projection distortions or limitations.

**Tip:** Include clear citations for data sources and projection information in a designated map area.

#### North Arrow {-}

A north arrow, though not always necessary, can be helpful for orientation, especially in unfamiliar areas or when the map projection alters traditional alignments.

**Tip:** If used, ensure the **north arrow** is visible and distinct from other map elements, and choose a simple design that fits the map's overall aesthetic.

*Rapid-Fire SDOH Mapping Critique*

- Spend 10 minutes critiquing a Social Determinants of Health map, focusing on elements like the title, legend, scale bar, and data sources.
- Think about the audience, hierarchy, balance, simplicity, and visual arrangement.
- Then, analyze another SDOH map, noting similarities or differences in design and effectiveness.
- Reflect on the clarity and informativeness of these elements, considering the context (what, where, when), the effectiveness of the legend, the appropriateness of the scale bar, the utility of the north arrow, and the clarity of data sources and projections.
:::

#### The Munsell Color System:

(Source: Del Mar College, 2020)

The [Munsell Color System](), a model for describing and communicating color, is crucial in map design. It categorizes color into three dimensions: hue, value, and chroma, aiding in systematic color selection and specification. In mapping, it helps in color selection, achieving contrast, creating color harmony, and ensuring accessibility. For example, Colorbrewer 2.0 provides options suitable for colorblind individuals.

# Data Wrangling in R

In this part of our toolkit, we're going to learn how to do the same things we did with Chapter 4 - Spatial Data Wrangling, but this time, we'll use R code to handle our spatial data. 

### Getting Started {-}

R is a great choice for starting in data science because it's built for it. It's not just a programming language, it is a whole system with tools and libraries made to help you think and work like a data scientist easily.

We assume a basic knowledge of R and coding languages for these toolkits. For most of the tutorials in this toolkit, you’ll need to have R and RStudio downloaded and installed on your system. You should be able to install packages, know how to find the address to a folder on your computer system, and have very basic familiarity with R.

### Tutorials for R {-}

If you are new to R, we recommend the following [intro-level tutorials](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) provided through [installation guides](https://rspatial.org/intr/1-introduction.html). You can also refer to this [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) tutorial developed by Data Carpentry for a refresher.

You can also visit the [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/) page to select a learning path tailored to your experience level ([Beginners](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/), [Intermediates](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/intermediate/), [Experts](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/expert/)). They offer detailed instructions to learners at different stages of their R journey.


## Environmental Setup

Getting started with data analysis in R involves a few preliminary steps, including downloading datasets and setting up a working directory. This introduction will guide you through these essential steps to ensure a smooth start to your data analysis journey in R.

:::tools
**Download the Activity Datasets**

Please download and unzip this file to get started: [SDOHPlace-DataWrangling.zip](https://github.com/healthyregions/sdohplace-toolkit/raw/main/data/SDOHPlace-DataWrangling.zip)
:::

### Setting Up the Working Directory {-}

Setting up a working directory in R is crucial as it defines the location on your computer where your files and scripts will be saved and accessed. You can set the working directory to any folder on your system where you plan to store your datasets and R scripts. To set your working directory, use the `setwd("/path/to/your/directory")` and specify the path to your desired directory. 

### Installing & Working with R Libraries {-}

Before starting operations related to spatial data, we need to complete an environmental setup. This workshop requires several packages, which can be installed from CRAN:

- `sf`: simplifies spatial data manipulation
- `tmap`: streamlines thematic map creation
- `dplyr`: facilitates data manipulation
- `tidygeocoder`: converts addresses to coordinates easily

Uncomment to install packages with code snippet below. You only need to install packages once in an R environment.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("sf", "tmap", "tidygeocoder", "dplyr")
```

:::tip
**Installation Tip**

For Mac users, check out https://github.com/r-spatial/sf for additional tips if you run into errors when installing the `sf` package. Using homebrew to install `gdal` usually fixes any remaining issues.
:::

Now, loading the required libraries for further steps:

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)
```


## Intro to Spatial Data

Spatial data analysis in R provides a robust framework for understanding geographical information, enabling users to explore, visualize, and model spatial relationships directly within their data. Through the integration of specialized packages like sf for spatial data manipulation, ggplot2 and tmap for advanced mapping, and tidygeocoder for geocoding, R becomes a powerful tool for geographic data science. This ecosystem allows researchers and analysts to uncover spatial patterns, analyze geographic trends, and produce detailed maps that convey complex information intuitively.

### Load Spatial Data {-}

We need to load the spatial data (shapefile). Remember, this type of data is actually comprised of multiple files. All need to be present in order to read correctly. Let's use **chicagotracts.shp** for practice, which includes the census tracts boundary in Chicago.

First, we need to read the shapefile data from where you save it.

```{r load-spatial-data}
Chi_tracts = st_read("SDOHPlace-DataWrangling/chicagotracts.shp")
```

Always inspect data when loading in. Let's look at a non-spatial view.

```{r non-spatial-view}
head(Chi_tracts)
```

Check out the data structure of this file.

```{r data-structure}
str(Chi_tracts)

```

The data is no longer a shapefile but an `sf` object, comprised of polygons. The `plot()` command in R help to quickly visualizes the geometric shapes of Chicago's census tracts. The output includes multiple maps because the `sf` framework enables previews of each attribute in our spatial file. 

```{r spatial-view}
plot(Chi_tracts)
```


### Adding a Basemap

Then, we can use `tmap`, a mapping library, in interactive mode to add a basemap layer. It plots the spatial data from `Chi_tracts`, applies a minimal theme for clarity, and labels the map with a title, offering a straightforward visualization of the area's census tracts. 

We stylize the borders of the tract boundaries by making it transparent at 50% (which is equal to an alpha level of 0.5). 

```{r tmap-view}
library(tmap)

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_borders(alpha=0.5) +
  tm_layout(title = "Census Tract Map of Chicago")
```

Still in the interactive mode (`view'), we can switch to a different basemap. Here we bring in a "Voyager" style map from Carto, a cartographic firm. We'll make the borders less transparent by adjusting the alpha level.


```{r add-basemap}

tmap_mode("view")

tm_basemap("CartoDB.Voyager") + 
  tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_borders(alpha=0.8, col = "gray40") +
  tm_layout(title = "Census Tract Map of Chicago")
```

::: tip

**Tip**

For additional options, you can preview basemaps at the [Leaflet Providers Demo](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/). Some basemaps we recommend that work consistently are by:

- CartoDB (Carto)
- Open Street Map
- ESRI

Not all basemaps are available anymore, and some require keys that you'd need to add on your own.

:::


## Coordinate Reference Systems

For this exercise we will use `chicagotracts.shp` to explore how to change the projection of a spatial dataset in R. First, let's check out the current coordinate reference system.

```{r inspect-crs}
st_crs(Chi_tracts)
```

We can use the `st_transform` function to transform CRS. When projecting a dataset of Illinois, the most appropriate NAD83 projection would be NAD83 UTM zone 16N. Chicago sits within the area best covered by **NAD83 / Illinois East (ftUS)** (EPSG:3435). 

```{r }
Chi_tracts.3435 <- st_transform(Chi_tracts, "EPSG:3435")
# Chi_tracts.3435 <- st_transform(Chi_tracts, 3435)
st_crs(Chi_tracts.3435)
```

After change the projection, we can plot the map. We'll swith to the static version of tmap, using the `plot` mode.

```{r}

tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(Chi_tracts.3435) + tm_borders(alpha=0.5) + 
  tm_layout(main.title ="EPSG:3435 (ft)",
             main.title.position = "center")
 
```

What if we had used the wrong EPSG code, referencing the wrong projection? Here we'll transform and plot EPSG Code 3561, a coordinate reference system in Haw'aii. 


```{r transform-3561}

Chi_tracts.3561 <- st_transform(Chi_tracts, "EPSG:3561")


tm_shape(Chi_tracts.3561) + tm_borders(alpha=0.5) + 
  tm_layout(main.title ="EPSG:3561 (ft)",
             main.title.position = "center")
 
```

It's obviously not correct -- the wrong CRS can cause a load of trouble. Make sure you specify carefully!

### Refine Basic Map {-}

Let's take a deeper look at the cartographic mapping package, `tmap`. We approach mapping with one layer at a time. Always start with the object you want to map by calling it with the `tm_shape` function. Then, at least one descriptive/styling function follows. There are hundreds of variations and paramater specification.

Here we style the tracts with some semi-transparent borders.

```{r }
library(tmap)

tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_borders(alpha=0.5) 
```

Next we fill the tracts with a light gray, and adjust the color and transparency of borders. We also add a scale bar, positioning it to the left and having a thickness of 0.8 units, and turn off the frame.

```{r }
tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_fill(col = "gray90") + tm_borders(alpha=0.2, col = "gray10") +
  tm_scale_bar(position = ("left"), lwd = 0.8) +
  tm_layout(frame = F)
```

Check out https://rdrr.io/cran/tmap/man/tm_polygons.html for more ideas.

## Converting to Spatial Data


### Convert CSVs to Spatial Data

We are using the `Affordable_Rental_Housing_Developments.csv` in the dataset to show how to convert a csv Lat/Long data to points. First, we need to load the CSV data.

```{r load-csv-data}
housing = read.csv("SDOHPlace-DataWrangling/Affordable_Rental_Housing_Developments.csv")
```

Then, we need to ensure that no column (intended to be used as a coordinate) is entirely empty or filled with NA values.

```{r }
cleaned_housing <- na.omit(housing)
```

Inspect the data to confirm it's doing what you expect it to be doing. What columns will you use to specify the coordinates? In this dataset, we have multiple coordinate options. We'll use latitude and longitude, or rather, longitude as our X value, and latitude as our Y value.
In the data, it's specified as "Longitude" and "Latitude." 

```{r }
head(cleaned_housing)
```

Finally, we start to convert it to points. Be sure you use the CRS of the original coordinates recorded. In this case we weren't sure what CRS that was, so we use `EPSG:4326` to test.

```{r }
points_housing <- st_as_sf(cleaned_housing, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
```

View the resulting sf object with a basemap to confirm they are in the right place. Overlay them on top of the tract data, to confirm they are plotting correctly.

```{r }

### First Layer
tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_borders(lwd = 0.5) + 
  
  ### Second Layer
  tm_shape(points_housing) + tm_dots(size = 0.1 )

```

You can change the `tmap_mode` to "view" to add a basemap in an interactive setting, and then switch back to "plot" when complete. Because we'e plotting dots using *tmap*, we'll use the `tm_dots` parameter for styling.

```{r }

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(Chi_tracts) + tm_borders(lwd = 0.5) + 
  tm_shape(points_housing) + tm_dots(size = 0.01)

tmap_mode("plot")

```

We'll reproject to `EPSG:3435`, our system standard

```{r }
housing.3435 <- st_transform(points_housing, "EPSG:3435")

```

#### Write Spatial Data

Finally, we can save our points as a spatial dataset. Use 'st_write' to write your spatial object in R to a data format of your choice. Here, we'll write to a geojson file. 

Uncomment to run this line.

```{r }

#st_write(housing.3435, "housing.geojson", driver = "GeoJSON")

```

You could also save as a "housing.shapefile" to get a shapefile format, however you'll get an error noting that some column names are too long and must be shortened. Shapefile formats have a limit of 10 characters for field names. 

```{r }

#st_write(housing.3435, "housing.shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")

```
The file may still write, but the column names that were too long may be shortened automatically. 

To change column or field names in R objects, there are dozens of options. Try searching and "googling" different search terms to identify solutions on your own. 

### Geocode Addresses

Here, we will use `chicago_methadone_nogeometry.csv` for practice, which includes methadone centers in Chicago (center names and addresses). First we load the `tidygeocoder` to get our geocoding done. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidygeocoder)
```

Let's read in and inspect data for methadone maintenance providers. Note, these addresses were made available by SAMSHA, and are known as publicly available information. An additional analysis could call each service to check on access to medication during COVID in Septmber 2020, and the list would be updated further.

```{r}
methadoneClinics <- read.csv("SDOHPlace-DataWrangling/chicago_methadone_nogeometry.csv")

head(methadoneClinics)
```

Let's geocode one address first, just to make sure our system is working. We'll use the "cascade" method which use the US Census and OpenStreetMap geocoders. These two services are the main options with `tidygeocoder`.

```{r}
sample <- geo("2260 N. Elston Ave. Chicago, IL", lat = latitude, long = longitude, method = 'cascade')
head(sample)
```

As we prepare for geocoding, check out the structure of the dataset. The data should be a character to be read properly. 

```{r}
str(methadoneClinics)
```

We need to clean the data a bit. We'll add a new column for a full address, as required by the geocoding service. When you use a geocoding service, be sure to read the documentation and understand how the data needs to be formatted for input.

```{r}
methadoneClinics$fullAdd <- paste(as.character(methadoneClinics$Address), 
                                  as.character(methadoneClinics$City),
                                  as.character(methadoneClinics$State), 
                                  as.character(methadoneClinics$Zip))
```

We're ready to go! Batch geocode with one function, and inspect:

```{r}
geoCodedClinics <-  geocode(methadoneClinics,
address = 'fullAdd', lat = latitude, long = longitude, method = 'cascade')

head(geoCodedClinics)
```

There were two that didn't geocode correctly. You can inspect further. This could involve a quick check for spelling issues; or, searching the address and pulling the lat/long using Google Maps and inputting manually. Or, if we are concerned it's a human or unknown error, we could omit. For this exercise we'll just omit the two clinics that didn't geocode correctly.

```{r}
geoCodedClinics2 <- na.omit(geoCodedClinics)
```

## Convert to Spatial Data

This is not spatial data yet! To convert a static file to spatial data, we use the powerful `st_as_sf` function from `sf`. Indicate the x,y parameters (=longitude, latitude) and the coordinate reference system used. Our geocoding service used the standard **EPSG:4326**, so we input that here.

```{r warning = FALSE}

methadoneSf <- st_as_sf(geoCodedClinics2, 
                        coords = c( "longitude", "latitude"),
                        crs = 4326)
```

### Basic Map of Points {-}

For a really simple map of points -- to ensure they were geocoded and converted to spatial data correctly, we use `tmap`. We'll use the interactive version to view.

```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(methadoneSf) + tm_dots() 
```

If your points didn't plot correctly:

- Did you flip the longitude/latitude values?
- Did you input the correct CRS?

Those two issues are the most common errors.


## Merge Data sets

### Reshape Data {-}

Here, we are trying to use the `COVID-19_Cases__Tests__and_Deaths_by_ZIP_Code.csv` dataset to practice how to convert long data to a wide data format.

We subset to the first two columns, and the sixth column. That gives us the zip code, the reporting week, and cumalative cases of Covid-19. We want each zip code to be a unique row, with cases by week as a columns Choose whatever subset functioon you prefer best!

```{r}

covid = read.csv("SDOHPlace-DataWrangling/COVID-19_Cases__Tests__and_Deaths_by_ZIP_Code.csv")

covid_clean = covid[,c(1:2, 6)]

head(covid_clean) 
```

Now, we are trying to create a wide data set with the cumulative cases for each week for each zip code. Enter the code and you will see the new wide data format.

```{r}
covid_wide <- reshape(covid_clean, direction = "wide",
                      idvar = "ZIP.Code", timevar = "Week.Number") 
head(covid_wide)
```

### Join by Attribute {-}

Here, we’ll merge data sets with a common variable in R. Merging the cumulative case data set you created in the last section to zip code spatial data (`ChiZipMaster1.geojson`) will allow you to map the case data. You’ll be merging the case data and spatial data using the zip codes field of each dataset.

We've cleaned our covid case data already, but not all values under the zipcode column are valid. There is a row has a value of "unkown", so let's remove that.

```{r}
covid_wide_clean <- covid_wide %>%
  filter(ZIP.Code != "unknown" & !is.na(ZIP.Code))
```

Then, we need to load the zipcode data.

```{r}
zipcode <- st_read("SDOHPlace-DataWrangling/ChiZipMaster1.geojson")
```

You’ll notice that the zip codes are repeated in the zip code data set, and needs to be cleaned before we can continue with merging the data.

```{r}

zipcode_unique <- distinct(zipcode)

zipcode_unique <- zipcode %>%
  group_by(zip) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Now, the two datasets are ready to join together by the zipcode. Make sure to check they have been joined successully.

We'll have these joined datasets be called Chi_Zipsf, to denote a final zip code master dataset.

```{r}
Chi_Zipsf <- zipcode_unique %>%
  left_join(covid_wide_clean, by = c("zip" = "ZIP.Code"))
```

We'll reproject to EPSG:3435, the standard used in our study area.

```{r}
Chi_Zipsf.3435 <- st_transform(Chi_Zipsf, 3435)
```

### Join by Location {-}

We’ll create a spatial join with the housing and zip code data we've brought in.

In this example, we want to join zip-level data to the Rental Housing Developments, so we can identify which zips they are within.

First, let's try "sticking" all the zip code data too the housing points, intersecting zip codes with housing developments.

To do this, both datasets will need to be in the same CRS. We have already standardized both using EPSG:3435.

```{r}

Housing.f <- st_join(housing.3435, Chi_Zipsf.3435, join = st_intersects)
```

Don't forget to inspect the data. Uncomment to explore!

```{r}
#head(Housing.f)
```

We could also flip things around, and try to count how many developments intersect each zip code We can use lengths() to find out how many items are present in a vector. Here,

```{r}

Chi_Zipsf.3435$TotHousing <- lengths(st_intersects(Chi_Zipsf.3435, housing.3435))

head(Chi_Zipsf.3435)


```


## Inspect Data


### Thematic Maps

To inspect data from a spatial perspective, we can create a series of choropleth maps.


#### Example 1. Number of Affordable Housing Developments per Zip Code {-}

Choose the variable "TotHousing" to map total developments per zip coode, as we calculated previously. Here we'll map using Jenks data breaks, with a Blue to Purple palette, and four bins (or groups of data to be plotted). A histogram of the data is plotted, visualizing where breaks occured in the data to generate the map.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(Chi_Zipsf.3435) + tm_polygons("TotHousing", legend.hist = TRUE, style="jenks", pal="BuPu", n=4, title = "Housing Dev.") + 

  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
```

#### Example 2. Number of COVID-19 Cases per Zip Code {-}

Let's do the same, but plut a different variable. Select a different variable name as your parameter in the 'tm_fill' parameter.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tm_shape(Chi_Zipsf.3435) + tm_polygons("Case.Rate...Cumulative",
              legend.hist = TRUE, style="jenks", 
              pal="BuPu", n=4, title = "COVID Case Rate") + 

  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, legend.outside.position = "right")
```

### Map Overlay

#### Example 1. Afforfable Housing Developments & Zipcode Boundaries {-}

We previously translated the housing dataset from a CSV to a spatial object. Let's take an attribute connect with each point, the total number of units per housing development, and visualize as a graduated symbology. Points with more units will be bigger, and not all places are weighted the same visually. 

We use the "style" parameter to aadd a standard deviation data classification break. Check out tmap documentation for more options, like quantiles, natural jenks, or other options.


```{r}
tm_shape(housing.3435) + tm_bubbles("Units", col = "purple", style = "sd") 
```

Then, let's overlay that layer to the zipcode boundary.

```{r}
tm_shape(Chi_Zipsf.3435) + tm_polygons(col = "gray80") +
  
  tm_shape(housing.3435) + tm_bubbles("Units", col = "purple") 

```

You can also color-code according to the total number of units. Here, we'll add a palette using a "viridis" color scheme, as a graduate color point map. For extra style, we'll add labels to each zip code, update with a new basemap, and make the whole map interactive.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

#Add Basemap
tm_basemap("Esri.WorldGrayCanvas") + 
  
  #Add First Layer, Style
  tm_shape(Chi_Zipsf.3435) +  tm_borders(col = "gray10") + 
    tm_text("zip", size = 0.7) +

  #Add Second Layer, Style
  tm_shape(housing.3435) + 
    tm_bubbles( col = "Units", style = "quantile", 
                pal = "viridis", size = 0.1) 
  
```

#### Example 2. COVID-19 & Methadone {-}

In the first example, let create a map showing both COVID-19 and methadone clinic data (used in A.3). First, let's add our zipcode map.

With this overlay, we'll add a "hack" to include the methadone clinic points in a legend.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

##Add and style First Layer
tm_shape(Chi_Zipsf) + tm_polygons("Case.Rate...Cumulative", 
              style="jenks", pal="BuPu", n=4, title = "COVID Rt") + 
  
  ##Add Second Layer
  tm_shape(methadoneSf) + tm_dots(size = 0.2, col = "gray20") +

## Resources {-}

- For tips on using `tmap`, check out the online text, [Elegant and informative maps with tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/index.html) by Tennekes and Nowosad.

- Try out more mapping with the ggplot2 library. The [Maps](https://ggplot2-book.org/maps) chapter will give you a head start.  

- We highly recommend Chapters 3-5 as mandatory reading in this classic, [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) by Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow. Perfecting selections and filters in the *Attribute Data Operations* chapter will help you become a data wrangling master. Perfect distance metrics and essential GIS operations in subsequent chapters.

- The Appendix in [Gimond's Intro to GIS](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/introGIS.html) online book has a super overview of R examples, not to be missed.

- Another superb resource is [Analyzing US Census Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker, with some of our favorite examples of extracing & reshaping data directly from the Census using code. Highly recommended!
