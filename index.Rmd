## Preface {-}

The Place Project Community Toolkit aims to increase the capacity for community and civic organizations in health to:

 - Access and work with SDOH data (i.e., place/spatial data)
 - Use place data for social good and to further health equity
 - Develop engaging & compelling apps to inspire, activate, and retain users
 - Work within an open ecosystem infrastructure

In order to identify and engage with the necessities of different social actors, the community toolkit is based on the principles of Human-Centered Design (HCD). HCD is a well-researched framework that ensures the potential users’ desires, abilities, and contexts are at the core of interactive systems and applications. HCD consists of four main steps: identifying users’ needs, designing for those needs, evaluating, and iterating. Inspired by HCD, the Place toolkit is built upon an ongoing co-creation and evaluation process that leverages the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders, such as researchers, policymakers, and analysts.

The Place Project Community Toolkit connects equity principles with analysis and design of spatial visualizations for SDOH spatial data. This toolkit draws inspiration from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Commission’s findings, which assessed [how communities’s health and life expectancy are affected by the places where they live](https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/interactives/whereyouliveaffectshowlongyoulive.html). To address this issue, RWJF has previously created resources to [promote health equity](https://www.rwjf.org/en/building-a-culture-of-health/focus-areas/Features/achieving-health-equity.html).

Currently, the community toolkit contains six modules. Depending on your project's objectives, you can opt to undertake either one module or several of them: 

 - **Module 1** guides users in identifying and formulating their visualization goals, recognizing potential stakeholders, and     
  prioritizing health equity in their planning. 
 - **Module 2** emphasizes the importance of user-centered design principles in spatial visualization and evaluates various 
  engagement strategies with stakeholders. 
 - **Module 3** focuses on the integration of spatial data into projects, covering data-wrangling methods, technologies, and the 
  role of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in spatial visualization. 
 - **Module 4** delves into the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis in the context of social determinants of health (SDOH). 
 - **Module 5** introduces users to multiple low or no-code applications for creating mapping visualizations. These open-source 
  applications concentrate on four cartographic approaches for mapping SDOH: story maps, asset maps, thematic maps, and data 
  dashboards.
 - **Module 6** addresses how users can evaluate and disseminate their SDOH mapping projects, underscoring the importance of 
  ongoing stakeholder engagement.
